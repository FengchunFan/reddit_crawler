"Freelance nail artist?",2,"ucr","Hi, I’m a third year at ucr who is passionate about nails. Full disclosure, I’m not a licensed by the state to work in a salon, but I understand lots of girls work from home as freelance nail artists as a side gig without a license. I’ve been having a really hard time getting a part time job in retail or food service, so freelancing would help me out financially and allow me to keep perfecting my craft. I’m a full time undergrad student, so I could only take clients a few times a week at most, and I would charge relatively affordable rates since I’m just starting out. I’m still up in the air about all this, but if anyone has any questions or anything to add feel free to reach out, thank you :)","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12yvh4d/freelance_nail_artist/",0

UCR pros:
• It’s a UC
• I just signed a housing agreement close to the campus
• Close to a full ride

UCR cons and questions:
• They changed my major to Business Economics so I’m also wondering if I’m able to change my major after admission?
• Kinda far from everything but I don’t mind cuz I’ll be driving

CSULB pros:
• Near everything
• Good Marketing program
• Low acceptance rate and kinda cool I got in

CSULB cons:
• Still need to find housing
• Have to pay like extra $4k/semester but will be getting a job there

I submitted an appeal showing them the paid ParkMobile receipt and the time stamp saying I was running late to a discussion I was teaching. Got the appeal back this morning:

Appeal: Denied

"I am a Candidate Running for Internal Affairs : This is my platform and Feel Free to Ask me Anything",17,"ucr","Hello Highlanders!

My name is David Kiroloss and I am one of the candidates that is running to be your Vice President of Campus Internal Affairs! I noticed a lot of students have been on here asking about candidates and what their platforms are so I just wanted to introduce myself and do just that!

To provide a **TLDR** for this post since I do plan on being as thorough as I possibly can, my top four goals for my mission next year is to do the following: 1) Implement a 24/7 communal fridge system to expand food accessibility and combat food insecurity on campus. 2) Establish a Mental Health Awareness committee to ensure information of mental resources (Such as CAPS, CARE, etc.) are being effectively disseminated to students, coordinate peer support group sessions on topics such as academic stress, social stress, etc. to create a sense of community & safe space for students to express themselves, and to direct the members of this committee to go around campus and do something positive for students (like cards of encouragement & snack for students in the library during examination weeks). 3) Create a Discord server that is open to all students to access in order to enable the student body to have a direct line of communication with student leaders. 4) Establish a School Spirit committee to highlight all our amazing individuals, offices, and organizations we have on campus when they succeed, as well as to highlight all the resources & opportunities we have on campus. Feel free to ask my any questions in the comments and make sure when you're at the polls to vote **David Kiroloss** for **VP of Internal Affairs!**  


To start off, I just wanted to provide some background information as to who I am, what I have done while I was in office, and what I have been currently doing on my own time as a Highlander. During my time as a senate intern and senator for BCOE, I have successfully spearheaded the coordination of COVID-19 Supply Distributions, advocated for Academic Accommodations, and advanced efforts for Basic Needs development.

A critical issue that I have noticed during my time in office and out of office is that a lot of students are not aware as to what the office of internal affairs does in our student government structure. So **what is the office of internal affairs? What do they do?** To answer that, at it's core, the Office of Internal Affairs is the Highlander Community. It's focus is to support our students and to better the quality of life on this campus. It's focus is to present student concerns to Administration and develop solutions to these issues. It is the most Vital Office in our student government.

**The structure** of the Office of Internal Affairs is divided into five committees: Basic Needs, Diversity Council, R'Professional Closet, Academic Affairs, and the Sexual Harassment/Assault Prevention Committee.

My platform is to **Bolster Student Affairs.** My mission as VP of Internal Affairs is to better student quality of life by reinforcing current developments in Basic Needs, reinstating the Mental Health Committee, coordinating with student leaders to Identify Concerns, and advocating to enhance Student Quality of Life at our campus.

I know I have stated a lot of buzz words, which is why I would like to use this segment to provide a detailed list of how I plan on accomplishing the above statements. When it comes to **reinforcing current developments in Basic Needs,** I want to direct the committee to expand into other areas of basic needs besides only focusing on food & housing related concerns. In one of my psychology classes, I learned that basic needs also expands into financial security and social well-being, which is why I would like to guide the committee next year to organize financial literacy workshops, conflict de-escalation workshops, and collaborate with the office of financial aid to set days for students to come in and complete their FAFSA applications. Moreover, one of the bigger goals I have for the area of Basic Needs is to **implement a 24/7 Communal Fridge system** around campus in order to expand accessibility to food. Currently, the R'Pantry only has a 9am - 5pm schedule for students to walk in and access food, which I believe is an amazing resource, however, over the years I have heard that it is not the most accessible-friendly system since appointments are booked months in advance. I believe by having communal fridges readily available for students, it would further bolster efforts to minimize food insecurity on our campus. In order to ensure these fridges are stocked with food, I plan on collaborating with the Community R'Garden to utilize the produce that they grow which would support their mission of ensuring students are fed. Moreover, I want to collaborate with our community service organizations on campus to provide them an opportunity to have an impact on our college campus for service hours and to spotlight them when they are stocking these fridges. It's a win for our community service orgs and most importantly, it's a win for our students.

Second, **As VP of Internal Affairs I will** establish a committee in the student government that is dedicated to mental health on our campus. College, is downright stressful. As students, we are entering a period in our lives where we are adulting and we receive stress from different areas, such as academic stress, social stress, financial stress, etc. As an student who is using CAPs for counseling and support, I believe that this resource has helped me develop so much, learn how to cope, and become a better individual. I strongly believe that our student government should have a mental health committee to recognize the importance of mental health and utilize it's platform to ensure information of Campus Mental health resources are being disseminated to students. For as long as I have been around, I hear a lot of times that students do not know how to access CAPS or know that CAPS provides six free therapy sessions to support our students. Moreover, I want this committee to also have a tangible impact on campus. Simply disseminating information is the bare minimum for mental health awareness. I want to utilize this committee to organize set days for students to come in to a safe space and express themselves when it comes to academic stress, social stress, etc. I believe this would bolster our fondness as a community. Lastly, we all have heard the jingle ""Random Acts of Kindness"". I want to direct the members of this committee to go out on campus on a random day and do something nice for our students. In my time as a community service coordinator, I found the events where we made note cards and lunch bags for students when it was examination week to be extremely fulfilling as it made people's day a bit brighter.

Third,  **As VP of Internal Affairs I will** create a mass discord server that is open to the public so that students can directly message student leaders in order to identify student concerns. I believe this will increase accountability & transparency within our student government, as well as provide students with the convenience of voicing their concerns at the drop of a hat. Moreover, another critical issue I have noticed is marketing. The marketing of our student government is not as great as it could be. Having a table set up once a week for students to come to for information is an amazing program they do, but I believe it can be better. A Highlander once expressed this ""Students should not have to approach a table to get information, our student leaders should be approaching us"". I agree with this sentiment. In order to expand awareness of our student government and the events we host, I believe we need to be initiating the conversations and up our marketing game. As someone who has supported marketing for organizations I am affiliated with, I have learned some techniques as to how to effectively approach students. In essence, it ultimately comes down to having a normal conversation and asking if they are aware of x event/program. I will bring the knowledge I have to the table and show my cabinet how to proactively spread information on our campus.

Fourth, **As VP of Internal Affairs I will** work to support our commuter students and do whatever I can to increase their quality of life on this campus. While I was campaigning, a student expressed to me that the RTA Commuter transit bus has limited times where it reaches them and in order to make it to campus on time for their class they have to get up at 6:00 AM. It must be extremely stressful to have to do that everyday and I can empathize, as for one of my extracurricular programs that I am a part of, I have to get up and be at campus by 6:00 AM on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and it sucks. I respect our commuter students for being able to do that everyday. I believe that the student government can do something about this to expand the bus hours in order to provide some form of relief to this issue. Moreover, I know other campuses have fridge lockers for their students to store their food until they want to eat and I want to work with the HUB to implement these lockers for our students.

Fifth, our campus has a whole lot of diversity. We have students from many different backgrounds and as a student government, I believe we should do something to further embrace that diversity. When I was in high school, the student demographic was very similar as we had students from a variety of cultures. One of the things we did to embrace that diversity was that we held a week long event called ""The Multicultural Festival"". It was a wonderful event that we all looked forward to every year. Our school had an assembly and all of our cultural organizations would perform something from their culture during this week. Moreover, there was a day during lunch where all the clubs would bring a dish from their culture and sell it to students to fundraise. As the saying goes, ""Food is a great gateway to learning more about a culture"". **As VP of Internal Affairs, I want** to bring this event that I fondly remember to our campus community. We already have cultural organizations that have culture nights where they perform for their members, it's just a matter of coordinating a day with these amazing orgs. Furthermore, I want to utilize this event to put a spotlight on our ethnic & gender (E&G) programs at Costo Hall to set up a day during that week to host a Costo Hall Fair to increase awareness of our fantastic E&G programs.

Sixth, **as VP of Internal Affairs, I will** expand the R'Professional closet to provide workshops to students on resume building, marketing, email, and interview etiquette. An amazing program that the student government supports is the R'Professional closet which provides students with professional clothing for interviews/formal events. I believe that this is a fantastic program, but I know we can expand it to do much more for our community. If we are going to help students look formal, I believe we should be hosting workshops to show students how to conduct themselves formally to better their chances when it comes to job hunting.

Seventh, **as VP of Internal Affairs, I will** bring more educational resources to campus when it comes to adulting. A resource I heard from the highlander community that would be beneficial is to try and coordinate educational workshops on how to drive, file taxes, etc. As a student that is the son of parents that immigrated to the U.S. from Egypt, it was definitely a struggle to figure out how to be an adult on my own and I know there a lot of students out there that are in a similar boat. I strongly believe that by hosting workshops on topics of adulting will be beneficial for our community.

Finally, **as VP of Internal Affairs, I will** establish a school spirit committee in my office to focus on increasing Highlander spirit. I know we have all heard it time and time again that our school is known as UC Rejects. I believe this connotation of our school is a disservice to the morale and spirit of our exceptional community. This school has provided me and so many students with opportunities to pursue their dreams. We are still young individuals pursuing higher education to better our lives. And at the end of the day, that is all that matters. College is what we make of it, and I believe we should all be proud of ourselves for the trials and tribulations we had to overcome to get to this point in our lives. I do not believe that our campus spirit has to be down in the dumps and I do not believe we should be disappointed or ashamed to be Highlanders. We might not be as privileged as the students of UCLA or UC Berkely to enroll into a school with an outstanding school spirit & prestige, but I believe that this is an opportunity for our generation to be the ones that raised our school spirit and change the culture of this campus. We can be the individuals who changed the connotation of our school from UC Rejects to UC Resilient. This culture change is an opportunity for us all. It's an opportunity that nobody at any of the other colleges will be able to say they were able to make happen. I hope that **as VP of Internal Affairs**, I can **work tirelessly with everyone** to change campus for the better. With this committee, I want to utilize it to spotlight our highlanders being highlanders, our student orgs doing amazing work, our wonderful offices supporting our community, and showcase the resources & opportunities we have as a campus. On a fun note, I want to utilize this committee to create an event called ""The Highlander Games"" (A student I met today suggested that title to me) where we have an event for students to form teams and compete in some sport/obstacle course in order to fundraise for campus causes.

I do have some more ideas I plan on implementing for next year, but this post has been going on for a bit too long. As an end statement, Internal Affairs begins here, at home, by placing R’Students first and foremost! I am confident in my abilities and as Vice President, students will be R’Priority.  Feel free to ask me any questions! Thank you so much for reading my post to this point, I know it was a lot, but I want to be as transparent & detailed as possible about my platform. I wish you all the best for this Spring Quarter, go get that 4.0 GPA in the bag! :)","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12rwvih/i_am_a_candidate_running_for_internal_affairs/",11

"Grad Fair nonsense",55,"ucr","Hi guys, here’s a cute little map I drew to help clarify the grad fair stuff. I don’t have any friends who have done this (like many of us) and I didn’t go to the grad workshops (like most of us although I heard they wouldn’t have helped for today anyway) and I was overwhelmed with the chaos and disorder of the grad fair. I have horrible handwriting and I’m not an art major okay but I hope I can help. 

So you enter through the bookstore door and to your left where you typically pick up online orders is where you buy your cap/gown/tassel. But the line is not clearly marked and snakes through the clothing racks (because why would they have been so intelligent as to moving the clothing racks before this chaos?🙄). 

When you walk inside, you’ll see the mannequins and the center tables with yellow and blue UCR sweatshirts in the center of the store. The line starts around there and curves back towards the left, kinda in a random spot in the center of the basketball shorts and sweatshirts. 

Make a buddy in line because: when you wrap around to the area with the sashes, instead of intelligently having them available at the same counter where you get your cap & gown, you have to hop out of line to spend time choosing your sash, diploma frame, sash frame, leather diploma book holder thingy, and thank you notes. But if you leave the line, you can potentially lose the spot you just held for the last 2.5hrs. So, make a buddy to have them hold your spot for you. 

There’s a few different sashes: 

1. There’s the one with our tartan that says “class of 2023” on one side and (I believe) has the UCR seal on the other side. It’s like a *cottony material. It’s $50.*

2. There’s a *satin sash* with “class of 2023” on one side and the UCR seal on the other. *That is $50.* 

3. There’s a *satin sash* with “class of 2023” on one side and “first generation” on the other. *That one is $50.*

4. There is a *dark blue velvet sash* with “class of 2023” on one side and the UCR seal on the other side. It is in a *plastic rolled tube and it is $80.* 

5. There is a *bright yellow velvet sash* with “class of 2023” on one side and the UCR seal on the other. It is *also in a plastic tube and it is $80.* 

There wasn’t a price on the leather diploma holders. 

There’s a few different types of frames, ranging from $165 as the cheapest and $265? Or a little more as the most expensive. They’re very pretty and tempting to buy but you gotta think if/where you’re gonna hang your diploma up. It’s super cool and I wanted to get one but I also am like I’m really done with this place and don’t care about hanging up my diploma right now🤷🏼‍♀️. But that’s just me. 

But the sash, diploma leather holder, and diploma frames all gotta be chosen while you’re moving in line next to the notebooks and near the textbook pickup in the back of the store, while the line is still moving to get your cap & gown. Super unplanned and disorganized, I know.

On the right side of the store is random shit. You can get a cord for a $23 donation which is cool.

***There’s also pictures so don’t be like me and not brush your hair thinking a bun is acceptable because they don’t have a brush! These are the “official” grad pictures where you can add them to LinkedIn and shit. ***

Sorry for the lengthy post. I wish there would’ve been some heads up as to what was going on today and how things would be organized. It’s shitty that they have the sash and diploma stuff as a quick grab & go item when it should not be. I just wanted to provide some ahead of time info because I wish I could’ve had some.

I'm not sure what the process is to requesting the minor and how difficult is it to do so. I took math 9A and math 9b and received a B in both. Are these grades okay if I do want to pursue a minor in CS, or not good enough?

Also, I'm in my 2nd year, going into my 3rd soon so am I too late to try and take all the classes required?

Lastly, how difficult are the CS courses? How badly will I struggle if I have to take relatively difficult BIO courses such as CHEM and PHYS alongside these classes.

"Seeking Guidance and Information",3,"ucr","Hello everyone!

I'm hoping that someone can help me out in my search here and maybe provide some information with regard to my situation at the present.

Long story short, I was supposed to graduate this quarter with a Bachelor's in Political Science/Public Service, but the internship that I was supposed to be taking this quarter completely botched communication with both me and the department at large, so it fell through. As a result, I've had to change my major to general Political Science and am now in need of a four-unit course to graduate. I'm currently taking two classes, both on Mondays and Wednesdays, one from 12:30 pm to 1:50 pm and the other from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, and discussions on Monday from 9 am to 9:50 am and Thursday from 3:30 pm to 4:20 pm. Given this schedule, I have two questions. 

It would appear that Professor Nemati has a few slots open in PBPL 132. Is anyone taking that course and have his office hours information handy so I can stop by and discuss this with him? If not, does anyone have any course recommendations that I should look into joining?

Any and all help on this would be greatly appreciated.

Asking as someone not interested much in classical music, but more so in jazz and ""world music"" traditions.

I got in as a transfer with regents, transferring from UC Berkeley (withdrew from Cal 6 years ago). 

Berkeley's music department doesn't appeal to me that much because it seems really classical-focused. Would anyone be able to compare or speak to strengths / weaknesses of the UCR music dept?

"The trees…",24,"ucr","Ok ok I’ve heard so many people complain about the ~cum~ trees at UCR. Are they really that bad?(MY OVERALL QUESTIONS AT BOTTOM)

———————————————————————————

I went to Highlander day and I thought the tree were relatively ok. Like ofc they smelled when I was near them (esp near the med school). It wasn’t as pervasive in other spots tho. I was already reading of the complaints on the subreddit so it caused me to be more conscious of the smells. My mom didn’t even realize there was a smell. Although I was wearing a leather jacket that day and today I was going to wear the same one. However to my dismay I noticed my outfit smelled… off. I couldn’t tell what it was at first but then realized my leather jacket smells like those trees.

I’m hoping it wears off because my hometown does not have those trees lol. However, at UCR does all your clothing smell like that? I’m hoping not and that it usually it doesn’t. Since at highlander day you are outside the whole day (for the most part) so it’s probably not comparable to a regular day for a student (I assume students stick inside more often).

In addition, even if it smells, usually continuous stimuli (like a certain smell) is usually subdued by your brain anyway. Like you usually can’t smell your own scent. Sorry if that last part didn’t make sense this is what I’m referring to -> “Olfactory fatigue, also known as noseblindness, is the temporary, normal inability to distinguish a particular odor after a prolonged exposure to that airborne compound.”

———————————————————————————

Anyways in summary:
- Does the smell usually stay on your clothes?
- Do you notice throughout the day that the
   smell is there (on your clothes or outside)?
- Does the smell concern you that badly?


Thank you so much for reading through this!

Like this is the only thing that I am concerned about location-wise.

———————————————————————————

Edit:

Ok thank you all for answering my post! The main points that I got were mainly:

- No the smell is not as bad as some people make it out to be

- the trees could even be avoided (that’s not necessary but a good point)

- it can be more present during certain times (like it might be worse when it blooms or is hot outside)

- the smell usually doesn’t stay on clothes

- to complain ab the trees is just a joke/meme

- not letting it affect my college decision heavily
     (Yeah the trees are not that important. I already live to a tree which I am really allergic to and am fine. Based on the stuff I already know ab UCR versus my other options, I like UCR the most but there’s still info I don’t know. I just have a few things I need to research like what research professors are doing so I can get a very very rough idea of what opportunities I would be interested in, what clinical experiences I can get/are most popular I am going to email some med orgs ab this, etc.)

UCSC - it’s the closest to Silicon Valley so more job opportunities, also I really like the nature vibe of the campus.

UCR - cheapest housing out of all three schools and also I got regents scholarship would should help me get classes easier.

SDSU - can live at home saving money in the process, already have lots of friends who go here.

"UCSC v. UCR pros and cons",12,"ucr","EDIT : I JUST WANT Y’ALL TO KNOW ALL OF YOUR STORIES ARE INSPIRING AND FASCINATING : please keep typing them! You all have such impactful stories that help me understand the vibe of the schools.. and I just wanna say.. thank you, please keep commenting I read everyone <3

Hi, so I know you guys were probably flooded with 
these questions a few weeks ago..

The issue is that I am seriously considering UC Riverside right now! I was going to go with UCSC but the youtube vlogs of UCR make me think that this place seems really chill! UCSC is nice and all but the housing.. and vibes just throw me off.

I got into both undeclared, I’m waiting on three waitlists ( i would go and pay the deposit again if they got to me ) They’re all three schools I would consider.

But I feel like I’m leaning towards the engineering or environmental engineering track. I just wanna study like Elle Woods :)

What are some pros and cons?

I love to work out, I swim an hour of cardio and an hour or so of weightlifting 3 days/week
And I’d prefer it be balls hot than balls cold because I get sick easily! 

I love Vietnamese culture and food, but UCSC definitely doesn’t have that. But the VSA does seem cool! 
I really like being around other asian students just to know that we share a sense of community. I’m part of the LGBTQ community so I’d like to know how diversity is approached on campus!

I wanna eventually learn to cook but I have a feeling I’ll need the first semester to get my shit together.. and I’m kind of excited to have a roommate.

I also know that the housing is pretty godawful in UCSC and UCR ain’t that bad? I hear the area is really quiet but the housing is well priced. Also I just wanna say every post on r/UCSC is about housing or finding a roommate.. 

I’ve watched countless videos and while I wait for your replies I’ll watch countless more. Thank you for your time my possible? upperclassmen :) i know you’re busy and take time out of your day to reply to this sub!

I know this might be annoying but I’m seriously considering Riverside, even though its been like four weeks since my financial aid package should be coming in.. EDIT : 13.5kish compared to 7k at UCSC","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12hm0xx/ucsc_v_ucr_pros_and_cons/",33

Retired regional economist [John Husing ](http://www.johnhusing.com/)said in an interview that UC Riverside has been largely absent from discussions on the Inland Empire’s economy.

The university’s association with Beacon Economics had “defaced” its academic credibility and the decision to sever the relationship was “long overdue,” said Dylan Rodriguez, a media studies professor at UC Riverside and former chair of UC Riverside’s Faculty Senate who helped to circulate the faculty letter.

“UCR should not be applauded for ending the relationship with Beacon, it should be asked whether and how it will attempt to address and repair the damage that \[the\] relationship has already caused to \[the\] university’s research reputation..:

"pros of ucr",23,"ucr","as some of you are deciding between schools hopefully the community of r/ucr and me can help you out with the pros
i’m finishing off of my first year i realized a couple things 
1. ucr is diverse and rated number 1 in social mobility 
2. lots of opportunities to get involved (frats, culture clubs, club athletics)
3. has the largest src (gym) among all the other ucs (my favorite reason)
4. dorms are doable and is better than most campuses
5. in my opinion the campus has a modern design which i like a lot
6. no need for bikes or scooters to navigate through campus/ pretty small compare to other ucs
7. amazing professors (school of business/ CHASS)
8. i’m not sure if other ucs have this but nearly the entire campus runs on solar power
9. avocado, orange, and pomegranate trees
10. amazing concerts and events hosted by aspb and residential halls 
11. lots of support for minority groups (cultural offices, the well, CAPS, basic needs) — other ucs have the same offices but i’ve heard a lot of my friends from other schools say they’re not always active and since it’s overpopulated it takes a while for them to get to you

if i missed anything please write more.. i hope this helps to any students that are struggling to decide which school they want to go","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12g7698/pros_of_ucr/",7

I've visited both campuses and am equally happy. I know nothing about the classes, professors, curriculum, the details. Both are basically equidistant from where I live. Money is not a problem. Culture and social activity is important to me, but not the most important. Good professors and classes are important. 

My main goal is to just get a good job (preferably in SoCal) after college and start working. Idgaf about higher education.

"Opinions on Linguistics / Russian Studies programs at UCR?",1,"ucr","Good evening,

I am a high school student who will be applying to UC Riverside later on this year for Linguistics and I would like to hear from some current undergraduates or alumni what they think of the program at UCR. I've researched this school rather thoroughly, and I've looked through the UCR website and the Comparative Literature and Linguistics pages on the UCR website. I'd like to hear more personal accounts on the major and the experience from students, though.

&#x200B;

I am also conflicted as to whether I should take Russian Studies as a double major or a minor. I believe a lot of the graduation requirements overlap to an extent, and therefore should I just go on ahead and take a double-major and kill two birds with one stone or would it be too difficult? 

&#x200B;

I don't think it would be too difficult to do the Russian Studies double major, as I can already speak two Slavic languages (Serbo-Croatian, Polish), already have a basic understanding of Russian, and have a huge interest in history. Therefore, I don't think the workload would be too much on me (I hope?).

&#x200B;

Career-wise I'd like to probably become a language teacher, either teaching English abroad or teaching Russian through a school/other.

&#x200B;

"Creative Writing minor",0,"ucr","Hi r/UCR, I’m a high school senior who was admitted to UCR for Fall 2023 to major in computer science.

However, I’ve been considering a minor in creative writing, something that deviates from STEM. This is to maintain my interests and give me a creative outlet after mostly learning about computers all day. I’m still thinking about it, and I wanted to come here for advice.

Firstly, please don’t tell me that a minor in creative writing is “useless”. I want to have something in my college years that isn’t pure math and computers, and I understand that those who study art are often looked down upon (for stupid reasons). Plus, it’s only a minor. 

Obviously, pursuing anything in college is a lot of work. But, relative to a major, how much work is a minor? Generally speaking, is it classes everyday? 

For those who have studied (or are currently studying) creative writing or something related, whether as a major or minor, how was it? Did you enjoy the experience? Is the extra work worth it?

I was actually debating between switching my major to Pre-Business instead of Psych, but thought maybe it would be simpler just to minor in Business instead because math is not really my strongsuit?

"How is premed here?",1,"ucr","I'm very seriously considering going to UCR, and since I also want to go down the premed route, I have some questions about how premed is here.

1. Are there a lot of premed students? Like, is it harder to build relationships with your profs or join their labs because of the competition? 

2. How are the clinical opportunities here? I've heard that UCR is better than most colleges with getting good opportunities, but is it super competitive to get them/are there lots of applicants for the same positions?

3. Is the grading curve really terrible, or can you generally study your way around it?","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12el98d/how_is_premed_here/",2

For seniors graduating in CNAS, do you feel like the 2 years of online class has helped you raise your GPA, or were classes on Zoom maybe your downfall?

I’m curious since honors cutoffs are not official as of yet. Spring 2023 cutoffs are not based off of last year, but rather the graduating class of 2023, which hasn’t been calculated as of yet.

It could either stay the same or change! Keep your hopes up if that might fit you!

I am the quiet type who doesn't typically say hello to people, but when I do, it just turns into small talk and we never speak again. I never had someone try to have small talk with me by making the first move. All my life, I was never the popular, bubbly person who kept up with the trends. I have a naked face (no makeup) and wear just any t-shirt, tank top, or sweatshirt with either shorts or jeans that dont fit the popular ""aesthetic"". I was just never interested; it wasn't me. I consider myself to look moderately attractive, but its almost like the bubbly/extroverted people or the people in more expensive/trendy clothing walk past me or look at me like I'm beneath them or something. Maybe its all in my head but thats how Ive always felt I was treated. I want to know what makes someone look unapproachable?

"Niche Pros of UCR?",15,"ucr","Hi I’m considering UCR for college but I’m torn between UCR and CSULB. 

UCR is giving me the major I want to to (microbiology) but CSULB is only giving me pre-bio and that too in a major I don’t really want to do (molecular biology). 

However, CSULB has a lot of niche cool things like a free gym, lots of on campus student stores, lots of activities, on-site campus emergency buttons. Overall, I really like it even tho it’s a commute college cuz I like the walk and it’s cheaper than UCR. 

That being said, UCR is the better school. After all, it is a UC.

"UCR Incoming First Year Question",0,"ucr","Hi y’all! I’m currently admitted to UCR as a business admin major :) I haven’t heard the best reviews about the business admin program. My dream is to work at FAANG as a product manager. I was thinking of either minoring in Comp Sci while majoring in Business admin or double majoring in Business Admin and Data Science to give my resume a better standing. 
Please give me any advice on how to best prepare myself for this role early on: 
How can I network? 
What campus organizations should I get involved in? 
Should I try switching to CSBA major after May 1st? (Tried switching a couple of days ago and got rejected but I am planning on doing it again after May 1st for a better chance)
What are your experiences with the business admin major at UCR? 
Should I get involved in comp sci related clubs/organizations as well? 
Does FAANG provide entry level jobs to UCR business admin majors? 

Additionally I got invited to honors college and I’m going to pursue it if I get in (I’ve always wanted to graduate a university with honors) . 
I was planning on joining one business club, one comp sci club, and one fun club (boxing or Afsana seem interesting).
I’m definitely going to pursue a masters in comp sci and an MBA.
I’m planning on doing a study abroad over the summer if possible and doing an internship every summer.

Dear Students.

I am hoping to find a Spanish speaking student to help me with my (very) beginner Spanish conversation practice. To be clear, the candidate does not have to prepare anything. They just need to echo back my words with the correct pronunciation, and point out grammatical mistakes etcI envision 2 to 4 hours a week, paying $20 an hour cash.T he job could last all quarter (But I reserved the right to quit!)(in practice, most of the ""hours"" will be less than an full hour, I will still pay $20)It is hard for me to have fixed hours, so this would suit someone that is on campus a lot anyway, and has some flexibility.If you are interested, drop me an email, noting your time constraints if any (only available early,  only available lunch time etc).many thankseamonn

How long after grades are posted on R'web will our Transcripts reflect the completion of our programs and the conferral of our degrees? 

I ask because I am attending graduate school in may and would like to send in my official transcript as soon as I can (and I want to see my degree posted too, Lol). 

Please, Nice comments only.","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/125fps4/how_long_after_final_grades_are_in_will_i_be_able/",3

"How to survive Michael Pirrung? Chem00B",4,"ucr","Just like the title said. I'll be taking Pirrung this spring for CHEM 8B (Casselman's spots are already filled up) so I'd like to know how I can do well in his class. For context, I have a B in CHEM 8A and I plan to improve my time management and learning style for ochem, but I feel overwhelmed with the lecture notes and practice problems Pirrung has already posted and the ratemyprofessor reviews about how cut throat his exams are aren't helping me 😭
