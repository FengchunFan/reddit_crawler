TIFU by not wearing underwear.,4325,tifu,"(The event happened two days ago but I wasn't aware of the fuck up until now)

This past Sunday was a normal evening, got home from the gym, showered, threw on my favorite PJs and started to cook dinner. While my chicken was in the air fryer I was scrolling on Instagram. I saw some of my female friends go live. I joined in and started chatting with them and they eventually said they want to come and hangout at my house for a bit. When they got here we were sitting on my back porch watching Netflix having casual conversation and petting my dog. So kinda abruptly after only being here 20 minutes one of them said they wanted to go home. Kinda confused, I drove them home and that was that. Fast forward two days later, I stop by their house to pickup something I had left. My two female friends and their older brother (one of my best friends) had just got home. The two girls didn't even look at me and immediately walked into the house. My best friend walks over to me with a serious face and says I need to talk to you. Confused, I say ""sure, what's up?"" He then begins to explain that I had essentially flashed my penis to his sister and her friend multiple times that night. Literal dread begins to fill my body as I try to explain that it wasn't on purpose and it had to have been the old pair of PJs I was wearing at the time. If anyone has ever had to plead their innocence in a situation like this, let me tell you, no matter what you say it never sounds good. He seemed skeptical of my apology but accepted it and I left. I took it upon myself to write out an apology to them but they deleted me on socials without responding. 

TLDR: I accidentally flashed some close friends because my PJs had a hole in them. They think I did it on purpose and cut contact with me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/12yorx1/tifu_by_not_wearing_underwear/,630

"If soloing a dungeon is too difficult, you shouldnt be Guardian rank 11.",3630,DestinyTheGame,"So many posts here every day complaining about the difficulty of GR 11, how soloing a dungeon is way to much to ask for the average player. Its almost like some people forgot that Guardian ranks are supposed to show off you skill/dedication/experience in the game. If you cant solo a dungeon, then I'm sorry, but that means the system is working.

I recognize that this sounds elitist and im not one to gatekeep things, however people arent entitled to get the highest rank just because they play the game. If you want a rank that shows off your skill, you should be able to complete an activity that requires skill. Honestly it should've been solo flawless, and more than 1 dungeon, but thats besides the point. I know that Guardian ranks isnt exactly a perfect system, but this requirement isnt a failure of it.  


edit: I know some runs can fail due to server or game instability, this isnt about that. Obviously theres no solution there. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/12yosth/if_soloing_a_dungeon_is_too_difficult_you/,1323

Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor. The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tells the man to return in two days for the results.

The man returns a couple of days later and the doctor says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got bad news for you, you‚Äôve contracted Mongolian VD. It‚Äôs very rare and almost unheard of here in the US , we know very little about it.‚Äù

The man looks a little perplexed and says, ‚ÄúWell, give me a shot or something and fix me up, Doc.‚Äù

The doctor answers, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, there's no known cure. We‚Äôre going to have to amputate your penis.‚Äù

The man screams in horror, ‚ÄúAbsolutely not! I want a second opinion!!!‚Äù

The doctor replies, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs your choice. Go ahead, if you want but surgery is your only option.‚Äù

The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he‚Äôll know more about the disease.

The Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims, ‚ÄúAh, yes, Mongolian VD.  Very rare disease.‚Äù

The guy says to the doctor, ‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I already know that, but what can we do? My American doctor wants to cut off my penis!‚Äù

The Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs. ‚ÄúStupid American doctors, always want to amputate. Make more money that way. No need to amputate!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thank God!‚Äù the man exclaims.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù says the Chinese doctor. ‚ÄúWait two weeks. Fall off by itself!‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/12yehtk/while_in_china_an_american_man_is_very_sexually/,608

"Men shouldn't always be expected to make the first move, and it's the biggest reason for the loneliness epidemic",1825,unpopularopinion,"Approaching anyone in public nowadays is a complete shit show given how social media is the social world now, but for men always to be expected to make the first move has done more to stir feelings of loneliness and resentment than anything else I think. 

Let's start off with the fact that approaching women in public nowadays is a complete guessing game. With the obvious exception of harassing behavior, no one knows how a complemnt or request out will be perceived even if done with the best of intentions. While it is fair to say we should have different standards as to what is okay nowadays, something as innocent as this should not be perceived in the worst possible way as it often is. This is not to say you should never do it as sometimes it is unavoidable but I have heard this story a countless number of times, how scary it feels to initiate in any public setting in today's day and age. 

Also, dating apps have exacerbated this problem in the worst possible way. It's basically the exclusive way of dating nowadays, and men swipe right FAR more than women (without getting nearly many matches in the first place) and are always expected to not only make the first message, but basically have to sweep someone off their feet in order to get a response back. And this is not even taking into account whether the person is attractive or not. 

I don't know if there is an ideal solution to this but it's clear this is not working nor will it be fixed any time soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/12yr80c/men_shouldnt_always_be_expected_to_make_the_first/,930

My doctor took me seriously on a gut feeling!,4929,TwoXChromosomes,"We all had experiences or at least heard of run ins with doctors that didn‚Äôt take women‚Äôs pain seriously with fatal or dangerous consequences and I had quite a few of them myself.

For example my old ObGyn never took me seriously when I told him that hormonal contraceptives didn‚Äôt do what they were supposed to with me. He always said I just had to get used to them. Well guess what? I got pregnant while on hormonal contraceptives because I had a hormonal imbalance at the time and the pill kinda made me _more fertile_. Surprised pikachu face. My daughter is 4 now.

Well anyway, I have changed doctors since then and had a copper IUD put in by a nice older doctor two years ago. She has since left the practice and today was my first appointment with the new head doc in this practice. And she‚Äôs amazing!

It was supposed to be a regular check up, but I told hear that I kinda had the feeling that something might be wrong with the IUD. I didn‚Äôt have pain or a change in my period or anything. Just a gut feeling. 

She immediately said we will make an ultrasound to make sure. She immediately took me seriously. On a gut feeling. 

Turns out I was right! The IUD has dislocated and is floating somewhere it‚Äôs not supposed to. So now I‚Äôm gonna have to get it surgically removed.

The thing that amazes me the most about this is that my doctor wasn‚Äôt even surprised it was dislocated. Even though the chance for that is only about 5% and even lower after it‚Äôs been already in for 2 years. She was just very casually like ‚ÄúYes, your gut feeling was right‚Äù as if she didn‚Äôt expect anything else.

It honestly felt so good to be taken serious like that!

Just wanted to share this little positive success story!",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12yih37/my_doctor_took_me_seriously_on_a_gut_feeling/,143

I unionized with my (26M) dogs against my boyfriend (30M).,1544,pettyrevenge,"I was told to post this here from AITA. 

Background: My boyfriend (E) and I have been together for four years. Whenever I would come over when we were dating, his apartment was messy but it was blamed on his roommates. I‚Äôm very cognizant that I am particular in cleaning, so I thought it just wasn‚Äôt clean enough to /my standards‚Äô/. I moved in with him ~3 years ago and adopted two dogs together. 

I quickly realized we do not have the same view of what ‚Äúclean‚Äù is. We have communicated about it and he has made a lot of progress. But, he consistently does one thing: stuffs his colored striped socks into the couch. I have told him that I have had to chase the dogs around because they find them in the couch. He thought it was funny.

Over the last few weeks, I have bought multiple cloth dog toys resembling his socks and have trained my dogs to play tug of war with them. They will now dive for them whenever he‚Äôs laying on the couch and places them on the ground to ‚Äúpick up later.‚Äù I also do not stop them from playing with the socks anymore.

He came home yesterday and found his favorite pair of his socks decimated all over the living room and was furious that I didn‚Äôt stop them. I told him they were the socks he stuffed in the couch yesterday and he should have put them in the hamper. He stormed off to his office and is not talking to me. AITA?

Edit: my dogs do not ingest the socks, they use it as a tug of war object. Using this example, when the pair individually ripped in half, they were no longer interested in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/12yr8tz/i_unionized_with_my_26m_dogs_against_my_boyfriend/,144

"Have me work throughout the Pandemic, Promote me, and then don't accommodate my disability? You can pay my Short-Term Disability Insurance for that.",1971,MaliciousCompliance,"Let me go a little backstory first, I started working at Walmart before the COVID-19 Pandemic happened as a Full-Time Apparel Employee. I happen to have Grand-Mal Epilepsy that started in my mid-20s, around 2015. I'm also quite understanding of other people's disabilities and often try to work with them, since I can relate to having issues, (example: I use hand gestures and/or writing for deaf co-workers. This helps with basic communication that most hearing people don't bother with and it's normally appreciated that I do this.)

I got to stay in that exact same position throughout 2020 and part of 2021, naturally, I had to still go to work as an ""Essential Employee"", deal with anti-masking idiots, and worry about both my parents, who also work in retail. I managed to get myself promoted to the Digital Shopping Department by transferring stores and pointing out certain key skills I have that are really useful in retail in 2021.

I had politely asked for the minimal requirements from my department manager of: 1) being able to take medication at work, and 2) not having to bring orders out to cars because I lack what's known as an ""aura"". Basically summed up here, I can't sense seizures coming, through I don't have them very often due to medication, a Grand Mal + busy parking lot at work seems a bad idea.

My department manager agreed to this condition as long as I did other work to help out the Digital Team instead, which was completely reasonable to ask for in my opinion. So as per the request, for a lot of closing shifts I'd work I'd take up phone duty, pre-set up the orders to go out, and/or do returns for the department.

The issue here was the Personal Department person. She kept ""forgetting"" about my condition, repeatedly, over the next year. This was despite me: bringing in medical notes from my neurologist for my file, pointing this out more than once on why I shouldn't be scheduled solo, and having the department manager talk to her.

After over a year, she scheduled me completely solo for a closing, which I noticed and texted my Department Lead about. I did the official suggestion of hers, despite my thoughts that Corporate Walmart was likely even dumber than her on basic disabilities. I only asked for the exact same things I asked my department manager for, both very, very logical and minimal accommodation requests.

As I suspected, Walmart's Sedgwick said, ""we can't do this unless you change departments"" - all departments suggested either: wouldn't work, due to time and/or location, or they were back at the same level as Apparel, which would lower my position and pay. Sedgwick put me on an automatically placed LOA, after a few days, without my permission. This was ""to allow me to figure out what I should do"" over the next 4 months.

I called up and asked the Walmart Benefit Center about this. As of late 2019, Walmart signed all of their employees up for a free-to-the-employees Short-Term Disability Insurance without officially telling them. I filed to get this Insurance to pay for my entire LOA, politely my situation to a total of 3 people and was given the Short-Term Disability payments, with backpay for exactly when they put me on leave. I'd rather have my paycheck and insurance stick around for a while despite Walmart & Sedgwick being idiotic.

Just had a moment in my life that Reddit prepared me for.,1713,CasualConversation,"I was on a plane. I'm a very long woman, as I like to say. Long legs, long arms. I always pay a little bit extra in my plane tickets so I can get an aisle seat (I have anxiety issues, I'm working on them and try to accommodate myself as best as I can)

I pay to be the first group to get into the plane and the first to get out, so I got myself a 5C. I'm getting my things in place when a mother (50s) and her daughter (20s) appear next to me. The daughter sits next to me, in 5B, while the mother stays up, looking at me while I'm sitting back down. 

-Excuse, me, would you mind moving to my seat so I can sit next to my daughter? I'm in 6B.

I quickly apologized and said that I paid extra to have my seat, so I couldn't make that change.

I can't sit in center seats, moving to the 6th row would make me be in the second group to get out of the plane, so the extra I paid for that seat would be money lost.

She didn't ask 6C, but her daughter looked like she had no issues with their seats location. She got on her airpods all the flight.

Maybe if I was caught out of guard, I would have accepted the change and suffered in that center seat the whole trip, but having read the Reddit stories got me to stand for myself and my comfort. Additionally, the mother was no EP, she was very polite in the request and accepted my negative with no issues, so I had a peaceful trip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/12ymo6w/just_had_a_moment_in_my_life_that_reddit_prepared/,84

Met my 2s partner for the first time,3166,RocketLeague,"I'm not sure if this is allowed here but Rocket League is where it all started. If you don't feel like reading all this the long story short is at the bottom.

So, about 8 years ago I met one of my very best friends. We ran into each other for the first time playing hoops and partied up because we meshed well together. We won our fair share of games and then went our separate ways. About a month later, we ran into each other again by chance playing hoops. This time I decided to take a chance and invite him to my party on xbox while we were playing and I kept thinking, ""please don't be a squeaker."" Turns out, we were right around the same age, had a lot in common and we instantly vibed. From then on, a friendship and brotherhood was born. Over the years we would talk about finally meeting each other and hanging out for real but nothing came to fruition. Until very recently...
For my birthday, my girlfriend got in touch with him and managed to get him to come down and surprise me at work. She had me guessing all day but I never would have imagined that he would be standing in front of me. This is the first time we met face to face and it brings a smile to my face everytime.

Long story short:  I met my one of my best friends playing hoops and after 8 years of friendship, my girlfriend set up a surprise meeting while I was working. I had no idea",https://v.redd.it/o6vs3qbnr0wa1,178

[Megathread] WotC Confiscates Leaked Magic: The Gathering Cards from YouTuber,2300,dndnext,"*While this news story is off-topic for this sub, discussion will be allowed here due to its relevance to Wizards of the Coast. Please direct all discussion regarding this topic here. Other threads will be closed and redirected here as well. This post will be updated if there are any further developments in the story.*

Brief summary of events that have transpired, taken from *TheGamer* (article linked below):

> It appears the Wizards of the Coast has sprung into action only a few days after the massive leak of Magic: The Gathering's latest set, March of the Machine: The Aftermath. A YouTuber called Oldschoolmtg managed to get their hands on the cards and revealed most of them in an unboxing video. However, it seems that WotC has tracked them down, confiscated the cards and got the video pulled.  
>  
> In a new video, aptly titled ""The Aftermath of The Aftermath,"" Oldschoolmtg revealed that WotC has taken away the cards [and they]...allegedly sent the Pinkertons to retrieve the cards from him.  
>  
> ...  
>  
> Wizard of the Coast has responded to TheGamer, confirming these reports and saying that Pinkerton ""is part of [our] investigation.""

Stellaris Dev Diary #296 - Announcing Galactic Paragons,1605,Stellaris,"*by Eladrin and Petter Nallo*

[Read Dev Diary #296 on the Paradox Forums!](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-296-announcing-galactic-paragons.1578898/)  
[Read dev replies only!](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-296-announcing-galactic-paragons.1578898/?prdxDevPosts=1)

Over the past year we‚Äôve been working on several things in parallel. While PDS Green in Stockholm was building the First Contact Story Pack, our colleagues at PDS Arctic in Ume√• were working on a major project as well.

I‚Äôm extremely pleased to announce that **Galactic Paragons**, an expansion focusing on leaders and their impact on your empire, will be released alongside Stellaris‚Äô seventh anniversary on May 9th.  


[Galactic Paragons is now available to wishlist.](https://preview.redd.it/324k2gludvva1.png?width=2750&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dd882abea1cf308d4c477a32ba6be552d9b8e642)

  
‚ÄãI‚Äôm turning the diary over to Petter Nallo, who directed the development of [Galactic Paragons](https://pdxint.at/3Ar8J64), to explain their vision and provide a list of features. 

**The Vision of Galactic Paragons‚Äã**

Amidst the great empires of the galaxy, there are luminaries who rise above the masses. They take on many forms: cunning rulers, ruthless warlords, devout prophets, bold explorers, and visionary scientists. These leaders leave indelible imprints on their empires, etching their names into the annals of history and the collective consciousness of the people they ruled.

The **Galactic Paragons** expansion focuses on these extraordinary individuals, seeking to capture the essence of their epochal reigns.

**Tell us their stories‚Äã**

The new level up system will allow you to shape your leaders in a whole new way. Pick traits, select between Veteran Classes and find them positions where they may excel. They are also tied to the galaxy in a new way with a home planet, a previous profession and their own ethics. Follow their journeys and witness their unique destinies unfold.

https://preview.redd.it/zqlumrf3evva1.png?width=1004&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=759eab8ff576d0019caa351732d12f6da630b239

**The Council‚Äã**

A new ruling council is introduced, where characters in the highest positions of your empire may take their place. Powerful traits have immense influence over all that lies within your empire's borders. And from here, you can unleash political agendas.

https://preview.redd.it/csbuayr5evva1.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c0933704966db76d3d6b8afa010bf2e354d4d68c

**Legendary Leaders‚Äã**

Out there in the void you may discover powerful paragons. These may seek to join your empire depending on your ethics. Here, may be approached by greedy governors who grovel in the dust, cunning spymasters, prophets who disseminate knowledge of the Shroud and so on. But as you explore the galaxy you may also encounter truly legendary beings that may change the core of your empire.

**And then the rest‚Ä¶‚Äã**

There will be a new origin, several new civics, tradition trees, agendas, council positions and much more.

More will be revealed in the near future.

https://preview.redd.it/7238g5e35wva1.png?width=3960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73782f3fb5d45cf0babd95df9eb52aa4c548f490

**What‚Äôs Next‚Äã**

You may notice that May 9th isn‚Äôt very far away, so we‚Äôll be continuing a twice-a-week dev diary schedule until the anniversary and Galactic Paragon‚Äôs release. There are a lot of features to get through, so be prepared for some longer than usual diaries.

This Thursday we‚Äôll explore the Council, Leaders, and Agendas.

See you then!

"ULPT Request, how do I ruin a dangerous kid at my school's life without getting in a ton of trouble?",1832,UnethicalLifeProTips,"TW: Sexual assault, beastiality, incest?

i don't know if this is against the rules or not, I understand if it gets removed. 

a kid at my high school (kyle as a fake name) is known for being a creep and harassing more people than we can count. he has assaulted 20+ kids, majority of which have proof. I personally know his brother (who hates him) and I've seen Kyle attack his brother and hump him and grope him. I've also seen him hump his dogs on multiple occasions. unfortunately these were all videos so I couldn't stop it from happening. 

tons of people from my school have reported Kyle on multiple occasions and gave the school proof, and they've done absolutely nothing. they put up sexual assault posters to act like they care, but refuse to punish Kyle. the police have even been to his house, but they refused to listen to his brother and gave him a ""warning"". he's gotten beat up a couple times, but the school just suspends those kids and not kyle.

I personally do not think him being beaten up a few times is enough of a punishment for him. what can I do to either ruin his life or just make him miserable without getting in serious trouble at school or with police?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/12yjm58/ulpt_request_how_do_i_ruin_a_dangerous_kid_at_my/,239

"[Gaming] Disco Elysium was a game with heavy anti-capitalist messaging, and it was stolen from the creators by billionaires through fraud.",371,HobbyDrama,"Disco Elysium is a story-based role-playing game created by a group of Estonian artists. They poured their heart and soul into it and it ended up being one of the highest-rated RPGs of all time. But, the original creators of the game were ousted from their own company because of some very shady business practices that were taking place with the new owners.

**Development**

Let's start with some backstory of how this game was developed - I feel like it is important to understand the full story.

1. After the failure of his first book, the original creator of the game - Robert Kurvitz fell into a deep alcoholic depression and lost all of his creative drive.
2. However, he was pulled out of this stupor by two friends - Aleksander Rostov, an Estonian artist, and Kaur Kender, a businessman and writer.
3. This trio of friends/colleagues were tired of being poor, so they combined Kaur Kender's business expertise with Kurvitz and Rostov's artistic ability and determined that they wanted to make a game called Disco Elysium.
4. They threw together their remaining money and developed the game out of a dilapidated, abandoned warehouse in their hometown of Tallinn, Estonia. Kurvitz wrote scenes while Rostov painted them and they worked heavily to make their vision come to life. However, since they weren't professionals, they needed a team - and they used Kender's business experience to secure funding through a businessman named Margus Linnam√§e.
5. They moved to the UK, rented a proper studio, and hired a team of 30+ developers to make Disco Elysium into the masterpiece it is today.

The game turned out to be a huge success and was one of the most creative and innovative games the RPG community had seen in years - but, under the surface, **there were** **darker things happening**.

**The Story**

&#x200B;

Here‚Äôs a summary of what happened:

&#x200B;

1. Margus Linnam√§e had a controlling stake in the company due to his investment in the expansion of the studio (named ZA/UM).
2. After the release of Disco Elysium, Linnam√§e wanted to sell his ownership in the company for ‚Ç¨4.5 million.
3. Another Estonian businessman named Ilmar Kompus bought Linnam√§e's controlling interest in ZA/UM, making himself the new majority stakeholder in ZA/UM.
4. After he obtained ownership, the three founders of the company, Robert Kurvitz, Aleksander Rostov, and Kaur Kender - the reason that Disco Elysium exists in the first place - were removed from the team ""involuntarily"".
5. The trio, who were in charge of the development of Disco Elysium and were minority shareholders in the company, filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Kompus.
6. After their departure, it was discovered that ZA/UM was illegally acquired through significant amounts of fraud.

&#x200B;

**The Extent of the Fraud**

This fraud begins with a guy named T√µnis Haavel, who worked at ZA/UM as one of the executive producers of Disco Elysium. He is a shady character who was arrested in 2016 as part of a huge pyramid scheme he was trying to run in Azerbaijan. He avoided serious jail time, but he was forced to pay ‚Ç¨12,000,000 worth of fines to the government in exchange for the leniency. It is assumed that this money was never repaid.

In the eyes of the government, T√µnis Haavel needed to be ""broke"". Any money or companies that he owned would show up as a red flag for the government and he would be forced to pay the money.

But, he had partial ownership of ZA/UM through his girlfriend's name, who was an investor in the company.

Through his girlfriend, Haaavel illegally sold Disco Elysium 2 concept art sketches to Kompus for ¬£1, who then re-sold them back to ZA/UM for ‚Ç¨4.5 million - thus paying for his acquisition of ZA/UM using ZA/UMs money. Then, the original creators were removed from the company because they began asking too many questions. This brought the fraud to light and created an insane chain of events that has led us to this point.

Lawsuits were filed and eventually, Kompus was made to repay the money that was stolen, but there are questions about the legitimacy of the money that was repaid. Even with the repayment, the original trio is still departed from the company and their firing has in no way been reversed.

The lawsuits have been settled, but it doesn‚Äôt fix the fact that the company was acquired illegally to begin with.

\-

The irony in this whole situation is that Rostov and Kurvitz were hardcore communists. The entire theming and messaging of their game satirically frowns upon capitalism and their rough history makes them have a hatred for the entire ideology. However, the game was stolen from them by the same billionaires that they talked negatively about throughout the entire 20+ hour game.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Company was fraudulently acquired, the original owners were fired from the team, and fraudulent money was repaid but the original owners are still fired.**

The Final Straw - going NC with my mother,987,insaneparents,"Re-post, but this time with more texts so it doesn't get banned - and a bit more context. These are the last texts between me and my mum (the group chat name was her idea, always made me balk) before I finally went NC. I had already cut contact with her once before and told her repeatedly (maybe 6 times) that I wasn't spending Christmas with her, despite her many texts, calls and voicemails. This was the final straw.

They're my step-brothers (not half brothers), and at the time she wrote this they were 14 and 15 (I was 25, which just makes this worse) and their mum had died less than a year before. Widowers are her thing (ick).

It was fascinating reading this after a couple of years break. The first message was a massive trigger, but I tried to calm it down by going along with it whilst gently telling her no. When I finally called her out she goes into ""I thought we had a special connection"", and when I maintain the boundary she goes to ""You're not my family anyway"". Any surrounding sweetness is designed so that if she's called out she can claim victimhood. The manipulation is so textbook I can't believe it took me 25 years to see it.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12ym7hq,225

"Pregnancy endangering a woman's life is ""very rare""",2305,badwomensanatomy,"Does this count? I (35f) just got in an argument with my dad (67m) about lateterm abortion. I said that nobody is just randomly getting lateterm abortions. They only do it when continuing the pregnancy endangers the woman's life. 
He said ""That's very rare."" I said ""So you're okay with letting those women die, though?"" He said ""It's very rare that a pregnancy endangers a woman's life."" That's when his words really sank in and I was utterly shocked and angry. I burst out ""Are you insane?!"" He said ""I'm insane now for saying something based on my medical knowledge?"" (He's a doctor. Psychiatrist, but that's still an MD.) 
I said ""who apparently has no idea of the history of women dying in childbirth for millennia!"" 
Maybe I shouldn't have said these things, but I was so damn angry. 
I've never been pregnant, so maybe I'm not one to talk, but I'm pretty sure pregnancy is very dangerous (even though it can and does go through fine for some). 

Any people who have been pregnant or are medical professionals, please chime in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/badwomensanatomy/comments/12yfd6l/pregnancy_endangering_a_womans_life_is_very_rare/,402

No pizza for choosing beggars,1327,ChoosingBeggars,"This is a story from my 10yo. His friend group has a habit of buying snacks in the nearby store, and once I pointed out to him that they could pool their money and get something better, like a pizza. It just never occured to a bunch of 10yos that they can buy something other than pre-packaged snacks. My son was very keen on the idea of having a little picnic with pizza and some soft drinks, to the point that he was willing to buy everything on his own and share with friends. 

He suggested that, the friends are happy, they go to the store to get their pizza (it's made right there and is more affordable than franchise places). There are several options, and my son has only one preference - no sliced tomatoes. Two kids from the group insist they will only have pizza with sliced tomatoes on it, or else they're out. There's a big discussion with drama and emotional blackmail. They end up buying nothing at all. It didn't even occur to the rest of the boys to leave the CBs out. They did get together the next day and got their pizza. My son paid for it, and other boys offered to pay for soft drinks. The word is, the CBs are still pouting about not being invited.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/12yj9ne/no_pizza_for_choosing_beggars/,144

And these anti abortion laws making peoples grandmas have more rights than their granddaughters like bruh?! And there seems to be a school shooting every day or so and that's just the norm, I've never heard of a school shooting happening here in my lifetime, worst thing that would happen is a fight club in the school toilets or something, and again the ""healthcare"" is absolutely insane, surely the richest most freedomest country on earth can afford the extra money to at the very least greatly reduce the cost of just plain staying alive, from what I've gathered if you're poor or lower middle class and have some serious but not terminal but still debilitating health issue you are just plain better off dying or going to prison if you can't afford the treatment, its just over, what the fuck. I am so thankful to be Australian and to never have to set foot in that bullshit place and deal with all this stupid laws and horrible economy, yeah aus isn't doing too hot either but if a 12 year old gets raped here she won't be forced to keep the baby which I feel should be a basic human right but clearly some Americans haven't really gotten the freedom thing worked out yet.

Two petty victories over Finance Karen,938,MaliciousCompliance,"My former employer‚Äôs rulebook says they would reimburse 45p per mile if somebody with a petrol/gasoline car needs to drive to the office, but only 11p per mile to EV drivers (even though you could argue that running costs are comparable if you factor in the higher price of an EV).

So petrol car ownership is a money spinner as most cost far less than 45p per mile to run, but with the recent increase in electricity prices, my EV now costs about 13p per mile to run if I charge it at home, or almost 25p per mile if I use a public charger (they‚Äôve all been bought by oil companies who now fix the price so it‚Äôs no cheaper than petrol). So no grifting profit for me. ‚òπÔ∏è

Finance Karen told me that‚Äôs government rules, and to look it up if I didn‚Äôt like it.

So I did. And I found that technically my car is a hybrid, as (even though it‚Äôs all-electric to the wheels) it has a generator which I could fill with 8 litres of petrol to recharge the battery and extend the electric range. I rarely use it, but it‚Äôs a loophole I‚Äôm willing to exploit, since company rules don‚Äôt mention hybrids but the holier-than-thou government rules say it‚Äôs counted as a petrol car for the purposes of reimbursement!

So I could drive to work for 13p per mile using only electric, but they‚Äôd have to reimburse me 45p per mile as if it were a petrol car. Government rules!

THERE‚ÄôS MORE! When I pointed this out, Finance Karen said that because I live less than an hour from the office, I don‚Äôt qualify for the reimbursement at all.

And she was right. If I was travelling to work at the time of day that she googled my address, it would take less than an hour. But if they wanted me to commute at rush hour, it would be 5 minutes over the threshold.

Finance Karen rejected my expenses claim, of course. I talked through all of this with my manager with the help of Google maps, and he went over her head and approved it, saying they‚Äôre either rules or they‚Äôre not. Karen can‚Äôt just bend them to suit her. 

So I won. A petty victory!",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/12yrp0p/two_petty_victories_over_finance_karen/,43

Struggling to make off-the-cuff NPCs feel distinct? Try using Pokemon Natures!,551,DMAcademy,"In the Pokemon games, each Pokemon has one of 25 natures, each of these increasing and decreasing one stat, including neutral natures that increase and decrease the same stat. These are all named after personality traits, like Adamant, Lax, Docile, Naughty, Modest, etc. If you roll a quick D25 for an NPC your players stumble upon that you don't have ideas for, you can get a starting point for their personality to improv off of and build something more fleshed out.

I particularly like this because just like Pokemon, you can RNG yourself into NPCs that have more or less suitable personalities to their station that affect how they'll interact with the party. Bluffing your way past a Lax guard would be very different from trying to get one under on a Serious guard. The stats affected can translate pretty well to personality traits as well, with Attack being aggression, Defense being stoicism/reservation, Special Attack being brains/cleverness, Special Defense being risk tolerance/aversion, and Speed being decisiveness.

You can find a full list of Pokemon natures and how it affects their stats all over the internet but you can see a basic table for them [here](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/618bef19b806d92a9d764ca1/21439ed7-8a85-4c63-a4f9-321effcb38f8/naturechart.png?format=1000w).

Have any of you tried something like this? What are your thoughts? I know ""roll for personality"" isn't a revolutionary take but I haven't seen this particular approach discussed before.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/12yozwj/struggling_to_make_offthecuff_npcs_feel_distinct/,37

"Anybody that thinks ""both sides are the same"" should watch the cannabis bill debate (or really any footage of the legislature)",2057,minnesota,"Not too say that all Democrats are great by any means - some of them certainly suck too. 


But there is a pretty clear demarcation between elected Republicans and DFL, so any attempt to paint them as ""both sides bad"" is clear gaslighting that only benefits the right wingers who would rather you not look into what they are actually doing.


Whenever a republican opens their mouth on the floor of the legislature, it's basically unhinged jackassery and/or shameless pandering to rich people. 


So if you think there is no difference between the parties, you would do yourself well to actually watch some of the debate.

"Ism√©t √°prilis, ny√∫lj magadhoz m√©g ma!",473,hungary,"Sziasztok, **√°prilis t√∂bbek a k√∂zt herer√°k prevenci√≥ra felh√≠v√≥ h√≥nap is.**

Id√©n **is** √≠rok egy posztot, ha csak egy embernek seg√≠t elker√ºlni b√°rmif√©le komplik√°ci√≥t, akkor meg√©rte.

lassan m√°r t√∂bb k√©t √©s f√©l √©ve, 27 √©ves koromban diagnosztiz√°ltak rosszindulat√∫ tumorral odalent, amit id≈ëben √©szrevettem √©s id≈ëben elmentem, hogy megn√©zz√©k mi ez


**Hogy vetted √©szre? Mit?**


El≈ësz√∂r egy pici bigy√≥/bogy√≥/gum√≥ t≈±nt fel ott lent ahol nem k√©ne, √©s ahol nem volt. 
√ân m√°r att√≥l megijedtem √©s foglaltam id≈ëpontot urol√≥gi√°ra, eleinte azt gondolt√°k ciszta, pici volt, de k√©t h√≥nappal k√©s≈ëbb els≈ë vizsg√°lat ut√°n l√°tsz√≥dott, hogy megn≈ëtt a m√©rete k√©zzel √©rezhet≈ëen is, UH-n is l√°tsz√≥dott jobban tov√°bbi vizsg√°latok alatt

**Mi volt ut√°na?**

M√©g 2020 √©v v√©g√©n elv√©geztek tumormarker v√©rv√©tel tesztet, √°m az negat√≠v volt, viszont az √©rezhet≈ë n√∂veked√©s miatt egy√©rtelm≈± volt, hogy valami nem k√≥ser, √©s cselekedni kell

2021 elej√©n viszonylag el√©g hamar a gyan√∫ ut√°n elk√ºldtek m≈±t√©tre, hogy kivegy√©k az eg√©szet (1db-ot csak, de az eg√©szet)  √©s akkor ut√°na a vizsg√°latok meger≈ës√≠tett√©k, hogy rosszindulat√∫, √©s lehets√©ges hogy terjedhetett, elk√ºldtek CT-re, m√©g t√∂bb tumormarker vizsg√°latra stb., de szerencs√©re nem volt jele √°tt√©tnek, viszont aj√°nlott√°k, hogy v√°llaljak be 1 k√∂rnyi kemoter√°pi√°t (1xBEP), amit bev√°llaltam, nagyon szar volt, de az√≥ta eltelt k√©t √©v √©s semmi jele √∫jabb betegs√©gnek ami onnan eredhetett volna.

**Felny√∫ltak?**

Nem, a prosztat√°mat nem n√©zt√©k meg k√©zzel, CT-n n√©zt√©k csak, de olyan panaszom nem is volt




**Minek √≠rsz ide?** 

√°tlagosan 26 √©vesen alakul ki a legt√∂bb heretumoros betegs√©g, de ez csak az √°tlagkor, ne f√©ljetek elmenni soha sem megn√©zetni ha valami g√°z odalent, ne f√©ljetek att√≥l, hogy megfogj√°k m√°sok √©s l√°tj√°k, nem √©rdekli ≈ëket az se ha kicsi vagy nagy a hossza 

legt√∂bbsz√∂r nem tumorod van, ha valami nincs rendben, csak heregyullad√°s (nagyon tud f√°jni, a tumor nem, vagy alig, tomp√°n), ciszta, vagy √°rtalmatlan semmis√©g, l√©nyeg, hogy **ne halogasd az orvost!**



**Mi√©rt ne halogassam? Hisz f√©lek, √©s m√°s megfogdos odalent**

Kor√°n √©szreveszed √©s kor√°n diagnosztiz√°lnak, akkor **t√∂bb h√≥napnyi szenved√©st is elker√ºlhetsz**, de t√©nyleg, ha nyert volna rajtam a f√©lsz akkor lehet, hogy 4-5 h√≥napig j√°rok kem√≥ra 1 k√∂r helyett, vagy m√©g rosszabb m≈±t√©tekre kellett volna v√°rnom.
Jobb ha sosem tudom meg, mi lett volna ha. 




**T√©nyleg ne halogasd, ha b√°rmi van!** 



Volt az √©letemben t√∂bb olyan ember is aki hasonl√≥n √°tesett, **ha ilyen redditor l√°tja a posztot nyugodtan √≠rja le saj√°t tapasztalatait, j√≥t, rosszat.** 


Fentebb √≠rtam, hogy √©n az√≥ta is j√°rok rendszeresen 3-4 havonta vizsg√°latra, CT-re is, de nincsen semmi jele visszat√©r√©snek, de ez kb. standard hogy ut√°na 5 √©vig viszonylag s≈±r≈±n kell n√©zetni.

*K√∂szi, hogy ha ennek hat√°s√°ra megfogdosod magad, ne legyen sose semmi ink√°bb senkinek. Bocsi a hossz√∫ √≠r√°s√©rt, tavaly r√∂videbb volt*",https://www.reddit.com/r/hungary/comments/12ypsnr/ism√©t_√°prilis_ny√∫lj_magadhoz_m√©g_ma/,48

"Just want to say, instant speed proliferating just as your opponent tries to pop their battle is one of the best feelings in standard right now.",698,magicTCG,"I‚Äôm playing a slightly janky U/R deck, focused around [[Ledger Shredder]] and [[Electrostatic Infantry]]. [[Experimental Augury]] has won me so many games by double boosting a creature and putting another counter on a battle so it doesn‚Äôt pop.

Edit:
Decklist, since some people asked
[Tappedout](https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/25-04-23-Khn-ur-thing/)

As I said, slightly janky, probably needs an update with some MoM cards. It was originally built with random stuff I had on Arena, cause I don‚Äôt play a lot.

The decks biggest problems is:
Mono-white enchantemnts, unless you get really quickly out, or they don‚Äôt draw more than 1 hallowed haunting.

Removal heavy control-decks, such as Arcane Bombardment.

Mono-black is shit, mostly due to Obliterator and Despair.

Everything else I‚Äôve played against I feel fairly fine with. 
RDW can be tough, but they can also just fold under your removal.
Green based Quirion Dryad decks is about outfrowing them.
Be careful not to overcomit if they have wipes, otherwise have fun, and do some surprise doubeling (both strike and spell) and grow some things.

Also, I don‚Äôt have a lot of time for Bo3, so the sideboard is very guessworky",https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/12ym8xs/just_want_to_say_instant_speed_proliferating_just/,88

Small rant: Why can't I be openly Catholic in nerdy circles? Why has trans-acceptance and pro-abortion ideologies infiltrated absolutely every one of my secular hobbies?,287,Catholicism,"I have multiple reddit accounts, multiple twitter accounts, and I compartmentalize my social media as much as I possibly can. 

Instagram is for art, not friends.  
Facebook is for friends, not politics.  
Twitter is kind-of for politics, but mostly for anonymous Catholic friends (unless it's my professional Twitter, then it's for career-related Tweets only).   
Reddit is for Catholicism... unless it's my alt account for my nerdy hobbies.

And why?

  
**Because I've been shunned several times in nerdy circles when they go into my post history and find that I'm very faithfully Catholic.** I've been told, ""This is a LGBTQIAA+ friendly nerd circle... so I don't think you would fit in at our event"" and I've seen people's jobs threatened because they weren't careful about what they tweeted.

Just today I watched a video from one of my favorite youtubers about how JK Rowling is missing the point of her own creative work because she's a TERF.  


Why is **freaking all of society** becoming so polarized on so many levels? I'm so tired of angering friends on both sides of the ""political spectrum"" because I'm ""too conservative"" or ""too liberal""

I'm tired of not being able to have every aspect of my life infiltrated by abortion or trans stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/12ytjjm/small_rant_why_cant_i_be_openly_catholic_in_nerdy/,123

M/25/(5‚Äô6‚Äù) [159lbs - 137lbs] (1 year 6 months),526,Brogress,"This is my 1 year transformation.

I went from playing 12 hours of video games a day, eating McDonald's, Pizza,Chips and candy- completely depressed, anxious and unable to socialize with even my own family. Isolated. 

For 10 YEARS. No life. No real friends. No hope of life getting better. My comfort zone crushing in around me, my pillow soaked with tears more nights than not.


Going from that- to the last picture where I'm completely anxiety free. Depression free. Where I wake up happy to be alive and not taking a day for granted anymore.

It took changing my lifestyle drastically. Going to the extreme and completely dying to my old self and my old ways of living. 

The best version of you is waiting. Seize it. I'm with you. The time is NOW.

Change your life DRASTICALLY. Smash your PC/ CONSOLE. Throw out the food that is RUINING your mind and body. You need to change up your habits and rituals.

You need to chase after change like your life depends on it - BECAUSE IT DOES!!!

From someone who has almost taken their life in that first photo I URGE YOU! Take control of your life right now. 

Stop living on auto pilot. Stop waiting for things to happen before it‚Äôs too late. You need to take action.

IM WITH YOU BROTHERS!!!",https://i.redd.it/z84jjvv7e3wa1.jpg,104

My first day I do the standard meeting with HR to go over orientation (it's an industrial and office environment so everyone needs to view safety videos.) The lovely HR assistant is also new, and I'm her first orientation without her manager supervising it. She's nervous and is fumbling a bit with getting her presentation going. Or rather, she's struggling with the mouse. 

Me: Something wrong?

Assistant: Ugh, it's this new mouse! I got it from [IT manager] but it doesn't work. 

Me: May I see it? 

Assistant: Oh, that's going to be your job, right? Of course!

I pick up the mouse and turn it over. The switch is toggled to on, but there's no sensor light. I open up the case. No battery. 

Me: Looks like it needs a battery in here.

Assistant: Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me?

She was horribly embarrassed, got a battery from a cabinet, and the mouse worked fine after that.

i correctly label my trauma and i get accused of exaggerating.,2101,autism,"my autistic brain feels the need to categorize and label my traumatic experiences correctly.

i feel like a lot of people allude to things too much, and those same people think i sound too ""severe"" and i have been accused of exaggerating.

the thing is: i'm quite literally not exaggerating. 

in high school i was accused of lying about being raped. what else do you call it when you don't want to have sex with someone, you say no, and they keep going until they feel satisfied? that's rape, my guy. it's not ""not being ready"" or ""not knowing what i want"". it's rape.

people keep telling me i wasn't homeless. what else do you call it when you have nowhere else to go but a shelter for 2 weeks? that's called being homeless! it's not ""being in the shelter system"" or ""dropping out"" or ""having a hard time"". i was homeless.

my mom got surprised when i called myself an incest survivor. what else do you call it when your family member molests you as a child? it's called incest. it's not ""they were inappropriate with me"" or ""a bad thing that happened when i was a kid"". it's incest.

am i crazy or do people try to downplay severe shit like this?

you can downplay your trauma as much as you want but i am entitled to correctly label my OWN trauma.

"Karen teacher tried to do the right thing, but ended up getting someone killed.",392,EntitledPeople,"This is an old story that my dad told me in the mid 90‚Äôs from his friend who was a firefighter.

Karen worked as a headmistress at a primary school in north London, this school was next to a very busy road that at the time had no speed restrictions, so a lot of idiots would speed past without a care in the world.

There had been many complaints from parents and teachers to the local council which were of course ignored.

One day a car driving twice the speed limit lost control and crashed into a parked car, the parked car then struck a child outside the school, the child was seriously injured but did eventually make a full recovery.

But this event inspired Karen to stage a protest by blocking the road, she got full support from the parents and her staff, so for the whole day they stood in the road not allowing ANY vehicle to pass.

While this was happening, a fire had broken out in a high rise flat, and the local fire brigade needed a specialised fire engine with the long Crain (I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre called) in order to reach the people trapped inside, unfortunately the quickest way there was through the street Karen was blocking.

The truck was trapped in the traffic and couldn‚Äôt get out unless Karen unblocked the road, but no matter how much the fire crew demanded and begged, Karen refused to let anyone through, her reason ‚Äúa child was nearly killed here‚Äù apparently she said this sentence repeatedly, even to the police when they threatened her with arrest.

The fire crew were held up for over 30 minutes until they got the call on the radio, they were no longer needed, three people died. 

The fireman in charge was so pissed he stormed over to Karen and demanded her to move the roadblock.
Once again she refused stating that ‚Äúa child was nearly killed‚Äù the fireman interrupted her and shouts in her face ‚ÄúSOMEONE WAS KILLED! BECAUSE OF YOU! I hope you sleep well tonight, because your actions cost people their lives‚Äù.

Karen then opened the road and stopped the protest, but later that day that fireman who chewed her out received an official complaint from Karen, for trying to blame her for the incompetence of the fire service.

Unfortunately I have no information about Karen or if she got arrested or sued, but nothing came of her complaint to the fireman.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/12yoy8c/karen_teacher_tried_to_do_the_right_thing_but/,27

A warning to my fellow devs,399,gamedev,"Hello my fellow developers.

Yesterday, I made a mistake, which ruined about 2 years of hard work in about 5 minutes - and now I'm making this post so you won't.

A person, claiming to want to help with pixel art for my game, seemed to actually have some nice pixel art. Me growing up in an environment of people actually being nice, I was really accepting of any help. Well, soon, the person wreaked havoc in my discord server, banned everyone they could and deleted quite a few channels.

"At my zoo, we circumcise all our gorillas because the eldest gorilla is Jewish and demands it.",971,copypasta," 

At my zoo, we circumcise all our gorillas because the eldest gorilla is Jewish and demands it. We can't argue with faith, and since we also shave our gorillas, we find the circumcised gorilla penises to be much more visually appealing, and I know our guests enjoy that touch as well because I've had many, many people come up to me and tell me how much they admire the penises on our shaved, Jewish gorillas, and that's when I take the opportunity to try to convert them to Judaism on the elder gorilla's behalf. I just want to make papa proud. I'd say at least a dozen or so people convert every summer, especially after the body show that the gorillas put on every 4th of July. It's part of why we shave them. We pump our gorillas up with the best bodybuilding supplements, legal and otherwise, so that they become absolutely jacked. They spend most of their time lifting weights and wrestling each other for sport and male bonding. The elder gorilla oversees the matches and presents a banana to the winner. That's what makes the body shows so popular. The elder gorilla is always very excited to show of the strength of faith instilled in his troop of Jewish, shaved, jacked gorillas. It's a very compelling argument, especially when you see how playfully those circumcised gorilla penises dangle in the morning summer sunlight, still with beads of dew clinging to that charcoal black gorilla dick skin. It's amazing what gorillas can do when they follow God's will and keep their hearts full of God's love.

Never again,563,ChoosingBeggars,"I recently had to move my mother out of her apartment and she had so much stuff I was literally giving shit away to get rid of it. Nice stuff, too. But I had to deal with so many CBs and people of that type. So many people wanted stuff delivered even though I was clear that it was pick up only. Does anyone even drive anymore? Why do all the carless people appear when I want to get rid of something? Why do all the carless people act like their choice to be carless is my problem to solve?

So I thought I'd start charging nominal prices for the stuff. Not to make a profit but just to weed out the weirdos. It made no difference. I gave away a newish custom sofa for $60. This was the one thing I was willing to deliver because I couldn't drag it out of the apartment by myself. But I told them to bring a friend because I could not help them load it in the truck (bad back). I made that super clear.

They sent one dumb teenage kid by himself. One. 

I offered the washer and dryer for free and OMG, you would've thought I had announced I was emptying out the Smithsonian. People kept messaging about it hours after it was gone. And I thought the ""nice going, you made my kids cry"" was fake, but people really say stuff like that. Sorry I gave it to somebody who was quicker than you, hold on while I take it back from them and deliver it to your house in a golden carriage.

I'm sorry to say that giving stuff away is not a viable solution anymore because people have ruined it. I paid trash haulers to get rid of the last few items that a younger, dumber me would've tried to sell.  And it was some of the best money I ever spent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/12yqtm6/never_again/,96

COMBAT BUGGY WITH SPG-9 RECOILLES RIFLE MOUNTED,522,shittytechnicals,"Fast combat buggys were widely used in modern military history, and again played a key role in the late 2022 Ukrainian offensives, the combination with this classic anti-tank weapon came from the need to project firepower over large flat areas in an agile and fast way, which is why several vehicles were armed with the SPG-9 to hit Russian positions and vehicles, and with its effective range of 800 meters it could even pose a real risk to an MBT ambushed and targeted by its lesser side armored.  This combination of speed and firepower is likely to be seen until the end of the war, and in later conflicts of our century.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/12yky8v,18

Celebrating One Year of Reddit Community Funds,223,reddit,"Hi Reddit[!](https://i.redd.it/4e1vs1gpv2wa1.png) It‚Äôs [u/Go\_JasonWaterfalls](https://www.reddit.com/u/Go_JasonWaterfalls/), VP of Community here at Reddit. You may remember hearing from me in r/reddit‚Äôs [very first \[test\] post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/sphocx/test_post_please_ignore/), which you hopefully ignored. I‚Äôm happy to be back today for an exciting occasion‚Ä¶ the one-year anniversary of Community Funds. Oh, [how time flies](https://i.redd.it/yoyfk9349ira1.gif).

Just a year ago, we formally announced [the launch of Community Funds](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/bringing-community-ideas-to-life-with-community-funds) alongside a $1 million commitment to bring community passions and ideas to life. Since then, you‚Äôve made magic happen with this one-of-a-kind program, from fundraising for local food banks to creating an art gallery exhibition.

We‚Äôre excited to recap some program highlights, celebrate all of the communities and redditors who have participated, and answer your questions about all things Community Funds.

**Community Funds by the Numbers:**

* **114 applications** received
* **14** **proposals** funded (and 14 more being considered)
* **$156,162** **in funding** disbursed
* **10 million**\+ **redditors** engage in these funded communities
* **6 countries** represented across these initiatives, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Australia, and Germany

[Reddit's Community Funds Program ](https://reddit.com/link/12ysaqi/video/x8c6vgg4s2wa1/player)

**Here‚Äôs what these folks have been up to recently with Community Funds:**

* [r/constructedadventures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Constructedadventures/) hosted an [IRL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Constructedadventures/comments/11z5joo/recap_of_the_4th_annual_grand_hunt/) and [virtual puzzle adventure](https://www.reddit.com/r/Constructedadventures/comments/124322t/digital_grand_hunt_recap/), involving their community during every step of the game construction and puzzle-solving fun.
* [r/alberta](https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/) partnered with other Canada-based subreddits to [raise funds for local food banks](https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/yjcyu3/ralberta_food_bank_fundraiser/). Together with Community Funds, they raised $54,055.69 CAD.

* [r/brasil](https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/) hosted an [AMA with author Carol Bensimon](https://www.reddit.com/r/brasil/comments/12iknmf/me_chamo_carol_bensimon_escrevo_romances/) after sharing her books, *O Clube dos Jardineiros de Fuma√ßa* and *Diorama*, with members of their community.

* [r/dankchristianmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankchristianmemes/) and the Dank Charity Alliance joined forces to [make memes and support St. Jude‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Research Hospital](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/10hvwf4/rdankchristianmemes_will_be_fundraising_for_st/). Together with Community Funds, they raised $25,586 USD.
* [r/povertyfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/) shared the ins and outs of their [Community Funds initiative to giveaway 500 Costco memberships in their community](https://www.reddit.com/r/CommunityFunds/comments/126r9e0/inside_community_funds_how_rpovertyfinance/). The highlights include: u/AMothraDayInParadise sharing their journey to becoming a mod of r/povertyfinance, meeting a fellow redditor in person to give them their membership, and all the logistics learned along the path to delivering the memberships to redditors in the UK, US, and Canada.

**Close-ups on Community Funds:**

Receiving funds at the end of 2022, [r/brisbane](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brisbane/) kicked off the new year with an [in-person gallery exhibition featuring their members‚Äô Brisbane-inspired artwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/yssanc/rbrisbane_gallery_submissions_are_now_open/). Several elements made this event successful, including a People‚Äôs Choice award for the most-voted piece of art ([u/femlocks received the award](https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/10swqsb/and_the_peoples_choice_award_winner_is_ibiz/)), and an in-person art auction with all proceeds donated to a local charity.

In 2021, [r/bangtan](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/) put out the [ultimate BTS fan challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptb/comments/rrbwm8/211229_permission_to_billboard_contest_winner/): design a billboard to be displayed in NYC and LA that celebrates the K-pop group Bangtan Boys. In collaboration with [r/kpop](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/), the response from designers, artists, and the BTS army was even more massive than the final billboards that appeared IRL.

**Reflecting on one year and a surprise AMA!**

A big, big thank you to all of the mods who have applied through the program and created high-value experiences that have built more connection and belonging between members in their communities. Since the official program launch, this includes: r/alberta, r/constructedadventures, r/dankchristianmemes and the Dank Charity Alliance, r/kpop, r/brasil, r/snackexchange, r/RandomActsOfGaming, r/handarbeiten, r/nascar, r/Brisbane, r/povertyfinance, r/LOTR_on_Prime, r/analog, and r/SantasLittleHelpers. (And shoutout to all of the communities that participated in the pilot phase, too.)

It‚Äôs been so cool to see the real-world value that communities have created with support from this program and we know that you‚Äôre inspiring others as community members, moderators, and organizers.

I‚Äôm sticking around for a bit to answer your questions about all things Community Funds ‚Äì whether you‚Äôre curious about how the program started or how you can participate. And I‚Äôm always happy to chat about what community means to us at Reddit and why. AMA!

Honkai: Star Rail Day 1 Survival Guide,1018,gachagaming,"&#x200B;

[Honkai: Star Rail releases tomorrow!](https://preview.redd.it/n6bbhyoa30wa1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b362744bb93a5cd8bde3acc75240b64914035f23)

Hey, it's Antillar again. Your friendly neighborhood guide provider from [Prydwen.gg](https://www.prydwen.gg/).

**Honkai: Star Rail releases tomorrow (and for some already today)** and we're excited to reveal that we managed to finish all our guides right on time! The H: SR section on our website is the **biggest so far** and we not only created at least **2 dozen guides but also developed tools** to help you with Team Building or Simulating the character's damage output!

This time we've partnered with 4 content creators to make use of their vast experience: [Volkin](https://www.youtube.com/@VolkinYT/videos) (a gacha veteran who helps F2P players survive in the games), [Grimro](https://www.youtube.com/@GrimroGacha/videos) (a Path of Exile theorycrafter who decided to venture into the gacha territory, and help us, mere mortals, with his simulations), [TimaeuSS](https://www.youtube.com/@TimaeuSS/featured) (another gacha veteran and guide-maker who spends copious amounts of money and tests fully maxed characters) and [Jenazad](https://www.youtube.com/@Jenazadp/featured) (a Epic Seven veteran who knows everything about turn-based games). All of them already created multiple guides and videos on their channels, so give them a watch if you want to learn more about H: SR!

# About Honkai: Star Rail

**Honkai: Star Rail is a turn-based RPG** very similar to old-school JRPGs (especially the Final Fantasy series). The game is split into two modes: overworld and battle. In the overworld, you run around the map and when you encounter an enemy group, you will  'transfer' into the battle mode where you have to defeat the enemies in turn-based combat.

If you want to learn more about the game, the characters, elements, paths, gear, and systems, check our [Introduction guide](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/guides/introduction-to-the-game) that compiles the information. It's a great starting point if you don't know anything about the game.

# Our guides

[Prydwen.gg Guides](https://preview.redd.it/4jqbkc4g60wa1.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a171e8b98771918bb86427b9c69a6963c24c6d1)

That's only half of the guides we have prepared for the release! You can find all of them [here](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/guides/).

Here are a few that are a great starting point (and obviously what everyone wants to know):

* [Reroll guide](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/guides/reroll) \- while rerolling in H: SR is painful, we still explain how to do it and who you should aim for if you decide to waste a lot of hours,
* [Early progression guide](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/guides/early-progression)\- this guide will help you avoid some early game pitfalls,
* [Team building guide](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/guides/team-building) \- this guide gives you a progression path using only F2P characters from the start of the story till the endgame. On top of that, there are teams for each of the 7 characters available on the newbie banner, to give you an idea of how to use them.

# DPS Ranking

[DPS Ranking](https://preview.redd.it/9dc3r7oqb0wa1.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=22a565926dfac474daf3288b0f3354ccd1645a56)

Among the tools we have available on the website, there's a [DPS Ranking](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/dps-rankings) based on simulations (that we tested in the Final beta to confirm our calculations). Just keep in mind that the numbers you see above and in the link are based on Final Beta balance and we already know there are changes upcoming for the release.

But have no fear! **Within 12h of the release, we will update the DPS Ranking** to take into account the balance changes. The new version of the DPS Ranking will also allow you to compare the Damage output between Eidolons (dupes)!

# Tier list

[Release tier list](https://preview.redd.it/keo3wsxfc0wa1.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aab76ca24e4ad4fdbec55f1c8a7c485d608acf55)

Obviously, there has to be a [tier list](https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/tier-list), but keep in mind that Honkai: Star Rail is **a very team-focused game and on top of that you can clear everything just using the characters you get for free** \- we did that in the Final Beta and some inside our team will try to do it again on release.

My (21F) bf (23M) was dishonest about having a kid. The kid is evil what do I do?,286,relationship_advice,"Throwaway account as my bf knows my other Reddit account.


my boyfriend and I were dating for 3 months before he told me he had a kid. He never let me come over bc he didn't want me to know because he was afraid of how I would react as I am very vocally anti kids. In those 3 months I definitely fell in love. I fell head over heels for him and once he realized he was falling in love too he told me about his kid.


Like I said I already felt strong feelings for him so I was willing to give things a shot and I met his kid. I brought some toys and his favorite candy and put in genuine effort to make a good impression on the child. The kid was really sweet when my bf was around and the moment my bf left the room to use the restroom his kid threw his Nintendo switch at my face causing a black eye. I figured he's having a hard time with his dad seeing someone new and not having all the attention so I gave him plenty of patience and took things at the kids pace. 


Well it‚Äôs been 6 months since then and the kid is literally one of the scariest kids I've ever seen. He puts on the sweetest front when my bf is around, the second my boyfriend leaves the kid is hitting me, pulling my hair, spitting on me, throwing things at me and then his dad will walk in and the child will run to the other side of the room and pretend he was playing with his toys the whole time. He also has thrown my belongings in the toilet and has thrown food and drinks at me.

He does things like this constantly and now it's gotten to the point that he does little things in front of his dad too and pretends it's accidental. For example a few days ago we were all playing soccer in the yard and every time I would take s break he would kick the soccer ball as hard as he could at my face. He did it 4 times in like an hour.
I know where the behavioral issue is coming from so I'm trying to be understanding and I really try not to force myself into his life. I just don't know what to do. I've never shown him it bothers me or that I'm angry about it because I feel like that would fuel it more. Where do I go from here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12yqaov/my_21f_bf_23m_was_dishonest_about_having_a_kid/,165

The Vex are becoming an incredible threat.,756,DestinyLore,"The Vex have always been a bit *less* of a threat to the Destiny universe than the other three 'enemy' races. Of course, on a cosmological scale l, they are innumerable and a universe level threat, but they have never truly obtained ""paracausality"".

The Cabal followed both Ghaul and Calus who stole and were granted paracausality respectively. Even the Psions of the Cabal Empire seem to have some level of paracausal knowledge and utility.

The Fallen are as familiar with paracausality as we are, and we've even seen them attune themselves to the darkness.

The Hive are,  or were, perhaps our biggest threat. They came to us with seemingly equal power, but from the darkness instead of the light. We'll see how strong Xivu Arath is soon, I'd imagine. 

The Vex, however, have only had fleeting moments of this level of power. While they are clearly a major player, they have never quite achieved the reality-warping power of The Traveler or The Witness.

#Until Now

The Vex have figured out, through the Vex Strike Force event, a way to Overload their reality through excess (the 'Supernumeraries') and cause reality itself to crash. 

The servers are dying, the game is crashing... do you all really think this isn't on purpose? The Vex have ascended beyond paracausality.

The Dauntless

&#x200B;

Gunnery Sergeant First Class Jurgen ‚ÄòGeorge‚Äô Jetson could describe himself as three things. Granted he became two of these things as a way to defy his older brother who always taunted him to the opposite, but he was these things regardless. He is fastidiously clean, very hard working and NOT a mind reader. The third one is what‚Äôs most important in this situation. Especially as a Lobster Centaur woman in what seems to be tinfoil armour has just scuttled up to him and banged her pincers on the ground before staring him right in the eyes.

He refuses to blink first, but she seems to have forgotten how to. Even when she was waiting in line with the Cloaken and standing out like a flare in the mess hall (long story), she hadn‚Äôt blinked once. Do Wimparas even blink to begin with? To make matters even more awkward he also can‚Äôt call in his fellow guard for backup. The man had been nearly late and Jurgen hadn‚Äôt had time to read his name tag between all the Cloaken hurling, actual guard work and whatever madness this was going to turn out to be.

The stare down continues as Jurgen‚Äôs fellow guard spins twice with a Cloaken teenager in his grip and lets her fly. She lets out a squeal of delight as the Axiom Totem she has on her person lets her float down harmlessly rather than crash onto the ground.

‚ÄúHey! You‚Äôre holding up the line!‚Äù A Cloaken girl who hasn‚Äôt even bothered trying to turn her clothing invisible as well shouts. Meaning that the Wimparas is getting shouted at by what seems to be an empty outfit walking around underneath a small flight of little hair decks suitable for a head of feathers.

The lobster centaur bangs the ground again with her pincers and she glances around. As she looks away he blinks and she looks back to him. She bangs the ground twice more.

‚ÄúOh for fuck‚Äôs sake, he has no idea what that means girl!‚Äù Jurgen‚Äôs partner calls out. ‚ÄúAnd stop being so stiff George! It‚Äôs alright to admit you‚Äôve got no idea what‚Äôs going on!‚Äù

‚ÄúI... I‚Äôm trying to... Uhm... I‚Äôm wearing armour, presenting my claws and lack of arms. This means I‚Äôm trying to sign up.‚Äù The Wimparas states.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre at the wrong entrance ma‚Äôam.‚Äù Jurgen says. ‚ÄúJust step to the side, we‚Äôre heading to our next post right next to the tertiary recruiting offices. Stick with me and...‚Äù

He looks at his fellow guard and clearly reads the nametag.

‚ÄúAngel.‚Äù Both men state. Angel with amusement and Jurgen incredulously.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really named Angel?‚Äù Jurgen asks and the man smiles and nods.

‚ÄúGrenadier Angel Escobar.‚Äù Angel returns and Jurgen rolls his eyes and gets a playful scoff from the other man in return.

‚ÄúWhy does your nametag read Jurgen but he calls you George?‚Äù

‚ÄúI share a last name with a cartoon character. So they call me George Jetson rather than Jurgen Jetson. Now if you could please stand to the side Miss...?‚Äù

‚ÄúLariana Greatshell.‚Äù She says.

‚ÄúOkay then. Please step to the side before...‚Äù Jurgen begins even as the empty clothes literally crawls over Lariana‚Äôs tail and she squirms and thrashes in response to the invisible lizard woman crawling all over her.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Jurgen says grabbing the woman via her invisible shoulder. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to crawl all over people.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut...‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease allow the young woman to move to the side first. It‚Äôs not like The Dauntless is going anywhere without prior warning.‚Äù Jurgen says.

‚ÄúActually, why don‚Äôt you go to the back of the line little lady?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù The Cloaken girl demands even as Lariana gets out of the way and she struggles to keep an amused expression off her face.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trading out in five minutes ladies. And miss Crawls Over Other Guests here isn‚Äôt getting tossed by me or Jurgen.‚Äù Angel states.

‚ÄúWhat!? But she was holding things up and...‚Äù

‚ÄúPatience is a virtue.‚Äù Angel preaches.

‚ÄúMostly because impatience has consequences. Step away girl.‚Äù Jurgen states.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo... it‚Äôs very fair, and that‚Äôs why it seems so unfair.‚Äù Angel replies.

‚ÄúWhat does that even mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt means you have to wait.‚Äù Jurgen says.

‚ÄúOh come on!‚Äù She protests and if Angel rolled his eyes any harder at that then they‚Äôd be at risk of coming out entirely.

Thankfully, minus the whining of a mostly invisible brat, this part of the guard rotation is over quickly enough despite Lariana‚Äôs fidgeting. It seems the stoic front when she was announcing herself with the claws smacking the ground was just that. A front.

Every guard rotation has three one hour posts followed by a patrol and then your usual duties. There were some arguments to simply having people stick out long guard shifts, but in the end it was decided on this method. After all, tired and bored guards are worse than no guards as at least you‚Äôre naturally paranoid about an unguarded approach, a badly guarded one gives false assurance. The movement keeps things fresh even for the dullest postings and the walk at the end wakes up even the most lethargic soldiers. And if the walk doesn‚Äôt then the change of activities will.

‚ÄúSergeant.‚Äù His relief say and salutes him. He recognizes this guy even without the tag. He was one of the reasons Jurgen had a First Class tagged onto his rank. Even if everyone‚Äôs competent and skilled someone needs to bark out the orders. Jurgen drew the short straw there and had the problem foisted onto him. Still, it was always good to see part of your anti-armour squad.

‚ÄúBazooka Joe.‚Äù He greets Yoseph and returns the salute.

‚ÄúGeorge Jetson, you‚Äôre fired.‚Äù Yoseph Adams jokes before smirking. ‚ÄúYou are relieved Sergeant, head to your next post.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the heck are you doing so close!?‚Äù Angel‚Äôs relief ‚Äòdemands‚Äô of the impatient Cloaken girl. He picks her up, takes a wide stance and hurls her like a shot put. ‚ÄúKeep some distance! Geeze!‚Äù

The mad giggling as the empty outfit rights in midair and touches down gently lets Jurgen know that the girl has learned little if anything for being made to wait. ‚ÄúSo who‚Äôs your friend?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is Lariana, she was confused as to where to sign up at.‚Äù Jurgen replies to Xin. The man bucks all Asian trends by easily being six and a half feet tall and built like he eats boulders and spits out sand.

‚ÄúRight.. well we have would be intruders as far as the eye can see. Time to clear through them.‚Äù Xin remarks.

‚ÄúMake them wait a bit will you? Don‚Äôt spoil them.‚Äù Angel tells him and gets a scoff in return.

‚ÄúAlright, this way Miss Greatshell.‚Äù Jurgen says and he begins to lead Lariana around The Dauntless and right to the next post, right around the corner from one of the recruitment offices. Like the others, it‚Äôs fairly swamped. Then there‚Äôs the clatter of claws being banged against the floor and Jurgen smirks even as he indicates the office. ‚ÄúSo that IS a normal thing for Wimparas. I had wondered.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would you think I would lie about that?‚Äù Lariana asks.

‚ÄúPeople claim all kinds of things.‚Äù Jurgen replies. ‚ÄúBest of luck young lady the training has several levels and each one is considerably harder than the last.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? But... I mean...‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat exactly do you expect?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, isn‚Äôt there some kind of secret?‚Äù

‚ÄúSecret? Are you referring to the Primal thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! Of course! Who doesn‚Äôt want to be a Primal!?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrankly I‚Äôd rather be my best because I earned it, not because I was born to it.‚Äù Jurgen answers.

‚ÄúYes but the first! The absolute first is something that never goes away!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd who was the very first Primal?‚Äù

‚ÄúUhm... Lashara the Serpentine?‚Äù

‚ÄúPretty sure that‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù Jurgen replies. ‚ÄúStill, there are worse reasons to sign up. Hell, some people do it for just money.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust money? Who the hell said that?‚Äù A Brute Archana decked out like she‚Äôs considering attacking The Dauntless on her own. Four massively powerful legs stomp up to him and she looms over him. Her natural posture similar to a spider rearing up would normally be massively intimidating, with it‚Äôs very solid stance and looming height coupled with their natural strength is generally terrifying.

Jurgen however, IS an Undaunted. She needs to step up her game to get him sweating. By a lot. ‚ÄúI did.‚Äù

She leans down to his level and looks him clean in the face, he notices that her eyes are cybernetic and clearly painting him with targeting information. Maybe if she had a rail gun or a rocket launcher this would be intimidating. But he has The Brand and as downright humiliating as it was to literally shit his paints as the pain made his whole body spasm, it had been worth it. All she has is lasers, plasma and brute strength. The first two don‚Äôt matter to him and the third he can match. Easily.

‚ÄúTell me little monkey. Do you fear death?‚Äù She demands as she pulls out a little tin of something and opens it. IT releases a pungent stench that visibly rises through the air and she inhales it gladly.

‚ÄúWhat are you trying to prove?‚Äù He asks her blandly and she raises an eyebrow. ‚ÄúLady, I shipped out to near certain death and found myself in the middle of what seems to be a porno. I don‚Äôt fear death, I‚Äôm half convinced it fears me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh really?‚Äù She demands leaning close enough that she‚Äôs trying to grind her forehead into his. To no effect. He may not have many dedicated neck exercises, but the sheer side effect of his flexing it while at the gym and really working hard has given him a very solid stance. She‚Äôs more likely to hurt herself.

‚ÄúReally.‚Äù He answers. Then she grabs him around the back and pulls him up into a kiss and then squeals before dropping him. Her bleeding tongue, shocked look and the gun barrel grinding against her stomach had changed the scene.

‚ÄúGet the fuck out.‚Äù Jurgen says as traces of blood and spit drip down his face. He got her good.

‚ÄúBut I... you...‚Äù

‚ÄúGet the fuck out.‚Äù He repeats as he cocks back the hammer on the pistol.

‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt humans like that sort of thing?‚Äù She asks.

‚ÄúNot me. Now get. The fuck. Out.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I just signed up for...‚Äù

‚ÄúUntil you take The Oath you can be kicked the hell out at any time for any reason. Such as attempted intimidation of a soldier in good standing, such as attempted assault of a solder in good standing, such as sexually assaulting a soldier in good standing in the midst of his duties. Now get the fuck out.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut...‚Äù

‚ÄúWe may need more experienced individuals, but a grabby legbreaker who can‚Äôt even control herself is just a liability. Get the fuck out. This is the last time I only use words.‚Äù He says and she looks down at the pistol and takes a step back. Then turns and leaves. He slowly lowers the hammer on his pistol and flicks the safety on before safely storing it.

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù Lariana asks.

‚ÄúArachnophobia. Just being near anything spider-like makes me want to scrub with steel wool and acid.‚Äù He answers with a full body shudder. He had kept his cool. He had kept his cool very well. But the moment she grabbed him it had been an internal war to not kill her.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She asks even as he pulls out a handkerchief to clean himself off before spitting in it to clean the blood out of his mouth.

‚ÄúPhobias are irrational fears. Arachnophobia is an irrational fear of spiders.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Oh! Do... uhm... does my lower body.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fine.‚Äù He answers and she breathes a sigh of relief.

‚ÄúOkay, one last question?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis has to be the last, I‚Äôm away from my post and that‚Äôs not generally accepted.‚Äù He says and she nods.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you use the larger weapon you have strapped to your back? Why did you use the one belted at your waist?‚Äù

‚ÄúToo big at that range. It would have been a fight to use it. The pistol could come out fast and clean though.‚Äù He says as he hooks his thumbs into his belt to stop his hands from shaking as he keeps fighting back the sheer waves of utter disgust and the urge to outright scream.

He‚Äôs going to need to talk to a counsellor. Maybe get drunk. Or both. Yes, he‚Äôs going to do both.

‚ÄúAnyways, here‚Äôs the office ma‚Äôam. Best of luck.‚Äù He states and then turns and walks away at the best march he can manage in order to keep himself under control.

Oddly enough throwing his first Cloaken good and hard is cathartic and lets him let a bit out. By the fourth crazy invisible lizard woman he decides maybe he doesn‚Äôt need to drink himself stupid tonight.

Try to move seats without permission? I think not!,1866,pettyrevenge,"Obligatory I'm-on-mobile disclaimer. 

I work in a theatre, and it's not uncommon for audience members to cheekily try and move into seats they see are empty. On quieter days, it's not a huge issue, however our unspoken policy is: wait until the interval, because we have a late seating policy and those seats may have been sold to someone else. Or at the very least, ask. 

On this day a while back we were fairly full (not to the brim, but enough), and I was supervising. My usher told me a woman moved a few rows forward and was argumentative when asked to move back, which she eventually did. Now, I don't have a problem with people moving along a few seats in the same row, because it's easy enough for them to shuffle back if they have happened to take up someone else's seat. But I draw the line at changing rows, especially when they have just been told no.

Well, the lights go down and the woman immediately moves back to the seat she was told she could not have yet (without her husband mind you!). And I go up to her and explain our policy and she flat out refuses to move. She says in a very entitled and dismissive tone, ""If someone comes, I will move."" 

Right then. I was now feeling petty and righteous. 

During late seating we wait for people for about ten minutes then let them in at the least disruptive time in the play. Alas, the seat the woman had taken hadn't been sold, but I had a plan, for I was on a mission! 

There was a couple set to be seated in the highest level ie the cheap seats, that I offered an upgrade to, because I could see the woman had trouble walking. My usher escorted them in, and I was delighted to hear about the woman trying to tell my usher (a different one to the one she initially interacted with) that she will move when people come. My usher said point blank, ""People are coming. You have to move."" The woman's husband leaned across, grabbed her and guided her back, looking quite embarrassed I'm told.

During the interval, I could see her surly, pouty face. Glorious. 

The irony is: had she asked nicely, I'd have been happy to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/12yfzwt/try_to_move_seats_without_permission_i_think_not/,51

Things I‚Äôm just not going to do for the sake of beauty,376,beauty,"There are so many tips that may be great and would have a good payoff for little cost and effort, but I‚Äôm just not going to do either because it‚Äôd be a pain or mildly unpleasant to me. Some examples:

Rinsing my hair with cold water before getting out of the shower, no. I get in the shower to be warm and happy, not cold and sad. 

Washing my face with cold water. Again, I‚Äôm not going to be needlessly cold for any reason. I used an ice roller once and knew it was a waste of money before I even bought it (I bought it for my ideal self, I‚Äôve since learned) I won‚Äôt massage my face with anything cold, I have hands that work just fine. 

Sleeping on my back to prevent wrinkles, I can‚Äôt do it. Even nine months pregnant I needed to somehow sleep on my stomach. 

Use any type of food based remedies: mayonnaise for soft hair, potato for puffy eyes, olive oil for skin. Gross, no. I‚Äôm not a salad. 

Multi masking. Who has the time for that? I can‚Äôt even consistently use one face mask on a regular basis, I use a mask once and then let it expire. I don‚Äôt even buy them anymore and just focus on a good daily skincare routine. 

Curling my eyelashes. A step I always skip because I don‚Äôt really see the difference and I usually pinch my eye somehow. 

Self tanning. I don‚Äôt have the time or patience for it and I know I‚Äôll mess it up and stain my hands, clothes, sheets, etc. I don‚Äôt even like the feeling of lotion so I hardly use that on my body either. 

Using eyeliner. I can‚Äôt do it. I have big round and deep set hooded eyes. There‚Äôs no point in trying anymore.

AITA for ending a friendship after being interrogated by the ethics department,265,TwoHotTakes,"One of my long time acquaintances, let's call him Miles (he also happens to be the spouse of my partner's best friend), had regularly mentioned being unhappy in his current job due to late nights, lack of balance, etc. His company happened to fall under a similar industry to mine and he always seemed like he really had his shit together. My partner and I also knew they were financially struggling through conversations with his spouse. When a job opening came up at my company, I gladly sent him the deets and gave my boss his name. I knew my company had better compensation, flexibility, and culture. It was a great opportunity and Miles agreed. And as it turns out, Miles got hired. I reached out to Miles to send a congrats and chat. Miles expressed having some anxiety about giving his current employer notice. I thought this was understandable and sent words of encouragement. I honestly never gave it a second thought. 

A few months later, things got a little weird. I was on a call one day and received a meeting invite from someone I didn't know... and the meeting was in five minutes. I reached out to the sender to let them know they must have the wrong person. She responded with, ""No. We have the right person. Please have your camera on for this meeting."" I hover over the name and see this person is from the ethics department. I'm immediately worried that I did something wrong, but I couldn't pinpoint a single thing that would have led to a discussion with ethics. I joined the call and was greeted by two individuals. After their warm greetings, they immediately switched gears and started asking questions. I was completely stunned and my heart racing. These questions were about my relationship with Miles. ""How do you know him? How did you meet? Would you consider yourself friends? Would you consider yourself best friends? How often do you speak with Miles?"" I explained that I could consider Miles a friend, but that, we weren't super close. That we spoke more sparingly prior to his employment at our company, but probably speak on the phone at least weekly now or meet for dinner. Then they hit me hard with... ""How long have you known Miles was working for X company and our company, simultaneously?"" I was completely speechless. I managed to tell them I had no idea, but they were questioning how I couldn't have known my friend was doing this. I told them I remembered him mentioning having some anxiety about quitting, but I never followed up with that. Because I assumed he would have quit the other job... like you're supposed to. Our new hire and annual training literally touches on this and Miles took that training! To make matters worse, it's a huge conflict of interest due to our relationship with the company.

I got off the call and my head was spinning. I immediately started replaying the last couple of months in my head. How did I miss this? I must be truly stupid. Because here were the signs:

1) My doctor's office is in the same building as the other employer. I would go every 2-3 weeks for my chronic condition. Miles would sometimes ask me how I was doing with my condition and when my next treatment would be. *I THOUGHT HE WAS BEING A GOOD FRIEND. Nope, he was giving his employer excuses to leave work on those days so I wouldn't see his car!!!*

2) Insisting to pay for our dinner multiple times, when our household income was at least 2x higher. 

3) Telling me he felt like his training wasn't the best. He felt like people weren't available to answer his questions. *Ya know, because he was juggling two 9-5 jobs so what an inconvenience that folks didn't immediately respond to him while he was taking a quick parking lot ""break""...*

4) Being super interested in learning how to use his work phone hotspot so he could work from his patio. *He was using it to work from his other job and didn't think IT would notice that much data was being used so consistently.* 

Here's the details on how this was initially discovered. We had a company event and a group photo was taken. It was posted by a coworker on social media. Someone at Miles' initial workplace saw the photo and said, ""wait... I know him."" He had told his workplace there was a family emergency and then proceeded to get dressed up and attend our company event. 

I told my partner about what happened and we had a long conversation. We both agreed, we didn't want this to affect the relationship between my partner and Miles' spouse. But that my integrity and reputation coming into question at my workplace was not cool. Someone that could live this double life for two months and lie to me the entire time is not a friend. So after much internal debate on whether or not I should call Miles out for this behavior, I decided to send him a long text. I needed him to know how terrible this made me feel and what it could have done to my career. I told him that I can't be acquainted with him anymore. He responded with an apology and said it was his anxiety. He planned to quit the other job, but he was just waiting for the right time, and it never felt like the right time. I empathize with anxiety and depression because I struggle with them daily. I let him know that I get it, but that I have to stick to my boundaries. This was the last time we spoke. 

Since then,  I've found out that his spouse never found out the truth of what transpired. His spouse refers to it as, ""their drama and I don't want to be involved,"" but told my partner entirely different details. The spouse has no idea Miles was still working at this other job. Miles told his spouse he was fired for working weekends at his dad's auto-shop. He lied and completely downplayed what he did to make it seem like an injustice. And now, I've found out that anyone Miles speak with about this situation thinks I'm an asshole for ending the friendship. My partner and I have not refuted any of this with Miles' spouse or others because we don't want to participate in drama, nor do we want to violate Miles' privacy.  

Reddit, I ask you this because in the past I've been told I'm too quick to shut people out. That I don't have enough patience with others and my sense of justice is too much. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: I forgot to mention that Miles was fired from both companies after the investigation. I was cleared, have a great relationship with my manager, and recently accepted a better position. A lot of folks are saying ITA for not telling the spouse. Trust me, I want to tell the spouse. When it did happen to come up once when my partner and the spouse were hanging out, the spouse had all the wrong details but said they didn't want to get involved in the drama. My partner respected that. However, I've taken everyone's comments constructively and plan to speak with my partner about this again. Maybe we can invite the spouse over for dinner one evening and get it over with. I'll let everyone know how this goes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/12yqaku/aita_for_ending_a_friendship_after_being/,67

The Forced Auction scam my wife and I fell for in October 2020 (still in operation after 25 years),465,Scams,"In October 2020, my wife and I were victims of an elaborate scheme, which resulted in us being sold five figures worth of fake paintings by an auction group (claiming to represent the estate of a wealthy local business owner).

[https://medium.com/@patrickberlinquette/the-forced-auction-a530165d8431](https://medium.com/@patrickberlinquette/the-forced-auction-a530165d8431)

These con-artists travel around the U.S.‚Ää‚Äî‚Äärenting out spaces at places like the Marriott‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto hawk fake art, rugs, jewelry, and even exotic cars. By the time the buyer realizes they‚Äôve been burned, the group is on to the next city.

Taking place just as we were emerging from Covid lockdown, the crowd around us was hungry for something unique to do, and unique things to spend money on. We watched as people dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars on fake jewelry for their partners (to applause). The drinks were flowing while the planted actors chatted us up, distracting us from any doubts we may have felt bubbling up. The environment the scammers manufactured felt exclusive and exhilarating, and we got caught up in the high.

In our journey fighting for our money back, we were introduced to a world of auction shills, fraud investigators, planted actors, art appraisers, as well as other victims who are trying to sound the alarm on this group‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwho is still in operation after 25 years.

Some sources are from textbooks/journals not available to the general public)

&#x200B;

**Why Should I Care?**

\- ""Each year approximately 476,000 Americans are *diagnosed and treated* for Lyme disease"" [source](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/humancases.html)

\- Early identification and treatment is key. Delayed/late/incomplete/inadequate treatment can be expensive and keep you off the course and lead to chronic issues. If caught early and treated early, you will likely fully recover and, more importantly, have more money to BUY MORE DISCS

&#x200B;

**What Causes Lyme Disease?**

A bacteria (typically *Borellia bergdorferi*)

&#x200B;

**How is Lyme Disease Transmitted?**

\- When an infected tick (mostly the deer tick *Ixodes scapularis/pacificus*) attaches to you and takes a blood meal. During feeding they regurgitate stomach contents/saliva (and the bacteria) into you.

\*\*IMPORTANT NOTES\*\*

\- Attachment: Ticks first attach to you before they begin feeding; a tick walking around on your skin is not taking a blood meal and is not going to transmit the disease to you

\- \*\*Feeding Time \*\*

* It is classically taught that the disease is transmitted only when the tick has been feeding for >24 hours (some sources say >48hrs)
* **HOWEVER, this may be incorrect** and there have been reported cases of transmission prior to this time point ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22104184/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22104184/)) ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4278789/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4278789/))

\- MORE THAN 66% of people with Lyme Disease DO NOT REMEMBER BEING BITTEN BY A TICK

&#x200B;

**Is Lyme Disease Present Where I Play?**

Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington D.C., West Virginia, and Wisconsin report 92% of all US cases. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/tickbornediseases/TickborneDiseases-P.pdf)

\- It is important to note that these data points are based on cases reported by health professionals to the CDC/government and the mapped to the patient's place of residence (not necessarily where they contracted the disease). It is estimated that the actual incidence of Lyme Disease maybe be >300,000 cases and that many cases are NOT reported.

\- Many states have their own reporting system, so checking your state's website will likely give you a good idea if Lyme disease is present

&#x200B;

**What are the symptoms of Lyme Disease?**

1\] Asymptomatic (incubation period): up to 30 days after bite

2\] Early Localized Disease: 3-30 days

* Skin Rash (Erythema Migrans - [PICTURES](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/NCEZID_rash_poster3r1-508.pdf)) - 30% of individuals MAY NOT HAVE A RASH
* Flu-like illness (fatigue, fever, body aches)
* Swollen lymph nodes (located near the bite site)

3\] Disseminated Disease: Days to Months ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/tickbornediseases/TickborneDiseases-P.pdf))

* Neurologic (15% of untreated patients) - may cause meningitis, nerve dysfunction (e.g. Bell's Palsy)
* Cardiac - (4-10% of untreated patients) - can cause heart inflammation, abnormal heart beat, passing out, death
* Muscles/Joints (typically a finding of late disease)- Joint swelling and pain

&#x200B;

**How is it Treated?**

If caught early, treatment with a couple well tolerated antibiotics (doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime) will typically result in complete resolution of symptoms and prevent progression of disease ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/tickbornediseases/TickborneDiseases-P.pdf))

[Tick Bite Prophylaxis](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/pdfs/lyme-pep-aid_digital-508.pdf)

&#x200B;

**How can I prevent it?**

1. Check your clothes / gear after rounds for ticks.
2. Check your skin for crawling or embedded ticks.
3. Shower quickly after a round. Ticks take a while to attach and begin feeding. Removal before they attach will prevent disease transmission
4. Wear long pants/sleeves to minimize exposed skin
5. Treat your clothes with permethrin ([https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/09/625459326/to-repel-ticks-try-spraying-your-clothes-with-a-pesticide-derived-from-mums](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/09/625459326/to-repel-ticks-try-spraying-your-clothes-with-a-pesticide-derived-from-mums))

Eiendomsmegler brutt regler?,320,norge,"Hei! 

Jeg har v√¶rt i en budrunde i dag som eneste kj√∏per. Jeg la inn et bud 250k under prisantydning som ble avvist. 10 minutter senere fikk jeg melding fra banken at de har bekreftet finansiering til megler. Megler kom s√• med et mottilbud p√• prisantydningen. Jeg ble mistenkelig og ringte banken. De bekreftet at megler har ringt til dem og bekreftet et bud fra meg som er 250k over det faktiske budet. Dette har √∏delagt min forhandlingsposisjon og jeg er forbannet! Dette m√• vel v√¶re brudd p√• noen retningslinjer eller lover for personvern?
Jeg har dokumentasjon p√• mine bud og har f√•tt dokumentasjon fra banken p√• budet megler bekreftet til dem. 
Noen som som vet eller har noen tips til hva jeg burde gj√∏re? 
Megler har gjort slik at mitt neste bud vil v√¶re enda lavere og har ikke opptredt til fordel for hverken selger eller kj√∏per.",https://www.reddit.com/r/norge/comments/12yo6uw/eiendomsmegler_brutt_regler/,97

A biology lesson for FAmy as to what botox is and how it works,241,DuggarsSnark,"I know you read here Amy that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm directing this to you.

Amy says that vaccines are toxic, but botox is made of botulinum toxin which is a literal toxin and one of the most deadly toxins at that. Granted, both vaccines and botox are perfectly safe when used correctly but you don‚Äôt get to claim one is toxic and get the other when it‚Äôs made of a literal toxin.

The reason botulinum toxin is so deadly is because it targets release of an important neurotransmitter acetylcholine from the pre synaptic junction. Your neurons have little gaps between them called synapses (also called synaptic junctions), these areas need neurotransmitters (mainly acetylcholine) to carry over the signal from the pre-synaptic junction (the one releasing acetylcholine and the one targeted by botulinum toxin) to the post-synaptic junction (the one receiving the signal from acetylcholine). These signals are important to maintain your bodies ideal conditions. But when the signals are blocked, your body cannot receive these signals resulting in paralysis.

The way botox works is that it blocks the signals for muscle movements in areas that have wrinkles.

Here‚Äôs my point Amy, sure seemingly dangerous ingredients are in vaccines and botox is made of one of the most deadly toxins on earth, but both are safe when done properly because scientists research the shit out of these things by understanding how things work on a microscopic scale.

Also while I‚Äôm at it:

#FUCK OFF AMY

Edit: botulinum toxin not botulism thank you for correcting me lovely snarkers",https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/12yqjf9/a_biology_lesson_for_famy_as_to_what_botox_is_and/,48

"AITA for not ""paying more""?",211,doordash,"long story short, I am a DD driver and also orders when I don't feel like going out.

my personal rule is I decline all orders under $2/mile with a few exceptions.

I recently ordered McDonalds when I was feeling bad and not wanting to go out, knowing this store is approx.. 3 miles from my house I tipped $6 which would be in addition to the base pay that's typically $2.50-$4.00 around here.

after 15ish min. of waiting I get a message from my Dasher demanding I pay her more or she will cancel the order because there ""is a line and I don't get paid to wait""

being a Dasher myself I simply tell them If they dont want to wait, they should cancel it so I can be reassigned.

5 minutes later I get the order picked up and OTW notification.

another 15 minutes later I get another message saying she is going to leave the order in my Mailbox (probably 400 yards from my house at the end of driveway)

10 minutes after that she finally shows up to my house to deliver the order, leaves it on the steps (which is fine as it was a no contact order) and leaves rather aggressively in my gravel driveway.

Order is Cold AF, drink spilled inside the bag and Nuggets were soaked in soda.",https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/12yria8/aita_for_not_paying_more/,68

Packages keep arriving at home from previous residents,605,legaladvicecanada,"I've moved to this house over 2 years ago and I'm still getting courier packages from the previous residents. It's been over 40 packages to date.  I've already contacted Canada Post several times and they will not take packages sent via courier at the local post office desk as it has nothing to do with them. 

The previous residents have been contacted multiple times to change their address but I still get their stuff. I've always stored their packages safely or contacted the seller (amazon, Ikea, eBay, The Bay etc) to request a stop.

The last straw was receiving a large book shelf this week. It was left in my driveway and I couldn't physically move it myself ( super heavy) so my parking spot was also gone. The previous residents then complained I damaged it because it was left outside for days and it  rained and wanted compensation. I told them to get off my property and never return again. 

 Am I legally able to leave all future parcels at the curb for the garbage? It's been 2 years and countless calls and emails already. I'm done with these people. Any advice would be appreciated.

Update: Thank you for all the advice. Based on the suggestions my next steps are:

- Send a registered letter to them noting all future courier packages (not regular mail) will be left at the curb or thrown out and I am not responsible for losses. And they are not to approach my house anymore looking for packages or I will call the police for trespassing.  I will give them 30 days to change the addresses from the letter date.
- put a note outside to the couriers to stop all dropoffs for XX names

Comex May silver contract open interest is 570% of registered silver with 3 days to first notice.,184,SilverDegenClub,"&#x200B;

Three days to first notice and the May silver contract has 34,893 contracts open representing 175 million oz. That is 5.7 times more metal than registered silver, the highest ratio in years. 

First notice day is Friday.

The privately negotiated trades were modest sizes yesterday and there were no significant midnight adjustments between the preliminary report and the final. It appears that yesterday's activity was fair play, unlike much of the prior couple of weeks.

The silver vaults saw a total of 1.1 million oz arrive split between Delaware Depository and MTB's vaults. Plus 300 k oz departed JP Morgan's vault ... still a possibility that move out of JP Morgan's vault is part of BofA's recently purchased 8 million oz. If you missed that, catch up here:

"Acabei de ser ""jurado de morte pelo PCC""",503,desabafos,"Eu estava caminhando e ouvindo podcast de boa, de repente, o podcast parou de rolar, quando isso acontece √© pq tem algu√©m me ligando e fui ver o que era. Era um n√∫mero com DDD 44 e eu moro na regi√£o do DDD 43. N√£o deu tempo de atender, ent√£o apenas ignorei. 

Pouco tempo depois, esse mesmo n√∫mero me mandou mensagem no whatsapp com o meu nome completo e perguntando se eu era aquela pessoa. Perguntei quem era e ele mandou a minha foto de perfil do Facebook com a palavra ""DECRETADO"" na frente. Logo em seguida, mandou um √°udio falando que era do PCC e que comandava o meu estado (sem falar o nome do estado). O mais curioso √© que sou do interior do PR e ele tinha um sotaque nordestino muito forte, na hora j√° parei de levar a s√©rio e passei a ignorar. Ele notou que eu estava ignorando ele e me disse que ia mandar ""os guris"" pra ir na minha casa conversar pessoalmente, continuei ignorando e em seguida ele mandou o endere√ßo da minha casa. O endere√ßo que ele passou √© de uma casa que eu morei h√° 15 anos atr√°s, quando tinha apenas 6 anos de idade, ent√£o resolvi bloquear pq vi que n√£o ia dar em nada.

N√£o satisfeito, ele mandou um v√≠deo de outro n√∫mero dessa vez com o DDD 48 (de SC) no v√≠deo ele mostrava duas armas (um rev√≥lver e uma pistola) e dizia que o Comando j√° tinha dado a ordem e que se eu quero problema, eu vou ter. Curiosamente, nesse outro v√≠deo o sotaque e a voz dele √© completamente diferente do primeiro √°udio.

Como eles est√£o desatualizados nas informa√ß√µes, acho que eles s√≥ v√£o descobrir o endere√ßo que estou morando agora daqui a 15 anos, ent√£o posso viver tranquilamente at√© os 36. D√° pra casar, ter filhos, comprar uma casa, fazer meu mestrado e doutorado tranquilamente etc.

Caso eu v√° de comes e bebes, j√° deixo anunciado que quero que o Goleiro C√°ssio do Corinthians compare√ßa no meu vel√≥rio

Por fim, gostaria de deixar aqui algumas dicas pros manos

* Invista em atores melhores e que passem alguma credibilidade, pelo menos com os sotaques e g√≠rias do estado
* Invista num banco de dados melhor, os dados est√£o desatualizados
* Investir num celular melhor, o v√≠deo estava com uma qualidade horr√≠vel",https://www.reddit.com/r/desabafos/comments/12yj6oq/acabei_de_ser_jurado_de_morte_pelo_pcc/,161

I wanted to quit this sub. Then I watched the last couple of episodes of Mandolorian.,192,saltierthancrait,"I joined this sub after watching The Last Jedi. My anger over the butchering of Luke's character in particular had me fuming. And the god-damned Holdo maneuver. And then the butchering of characters DISNEY CREATED like Finn. Then that last movie came out. Holy shit what a disappointment. But I don't want to hate what others love, just complain that it's not as good as it can be. 

But then I watched Rebels and early Mandolorian and thought, well, maybe I shouldn't be so salty. Maybe, Disney learned from the sequels and maybe the newer stuff would be better.

I thought, ok, maybe Star Wars isn't for me anymore. Lots of people loved the sequels. Lots of people loved the fourth season of Mandolorian. Maybe I should just be happy that someone is happy with this stuff. So I wasn't happy, but maybe I was missing something.

Now I realize that THEY are missing something. And that something is a little thing called ALL THE OTHER GOOD Star Wars stuff made over the years. I realize there's just a standard for Star Wars in my mind, and that standard isn't being met. Others may have lower standards. Or are new to Star Wars and have literally NO standards.

This standard is not being met a majority of the time and it sucks. So, while I get that some like the sequels and whatever new crap comes out will find an audience, I probably won't be among the audience. 

I'll still give things a try, but I'll stay subbed here for when the inevitable shit show or movies come out so I can vent my frustrations. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/saltierthancrait/comments/12yrst1/i_wanted_to_quit_this_sub_then_i_watched_the_last/,55

Reminder about human remains,224,bonecollecting,"Hello all, given a recent post in this sub, I want to make a little reminder about Rule 6.  But before I do, let me just clear one thing up. This is a sub about bone collecting, vulture culture, and bone identification first and foremost. Though we do get the occasional human bone, this sub is objectively not a crime sub. There are plenty of those out there for you to subscribe to, and they are entertaining.  Rule 6 exists SPECIFICALLY to avoid the unnecessary and often rampant speculation that comes along with the ""Could this be HUMAN"" posts. This sub has literally a dozen highly qualified and trained human osteologists (experts training in human bone identification). There is ZERO need to jump to conclusions and create unnecessary anxiety for OP over a picnic ham when we have experts (actual experts who ID human remains for a living) in this sub.

So in summary, if you are not going to take the time to ID it properly, then don't jump immediately to treating a bone like it is human and telling the OP to report it. That is literally the exact OPPOSITE of what this sub is about, and those comments will get removed under Rule 6.

&#x200B;

EDIT: and just to add to this, we also are going to be rolling out a new mod-assigned user flair for ""Human ID Expert"".

YSK it‚Äôs appropriate to call 911 for large debris in the middle of a freeway or busy road.,8436,YouShouldKnow,"Why YSK: it can save a life. 

I posted this on LPT, but it got removed. Fair enough, I guess this is more of a PSA. 

If you are driving and see something dangerous in the freeway, its a very valid reason to dial 911. 

A lot of people think there needs to be massive bleeding or an immense threat to warrant calling 911. But dangerous debris on a freeway *is* a deadly situation. Especially with how bad distracted drivers are these days. 

Even just a tire/wheel, for example, can cause a vehicle to flip. 

I‚Äôve seen a 6x6 piece of lumber laying across an entire lane. Wasn‚Äôt easy to see and can cause a massive accident. Yesterday I saw a ladder laying across an entire lane. From far back it looked like something you could just drive over. But an extension ladder is definitely not something you can drive over. Im sure you‚Äôve all seen crazy things in the road.

Calling it in literally takes about 10-15 seconds:

- ‚ÄúWhat is your emergency‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDebris in the freeway‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat is your location‚Äù
- ‚Äúinterstate X southbound, just before the XX exit.‚Äù
- ‚Äúwhat is your name and phone number?‚Äù
- ‚Äú[name] [number]‚Äù
- ‚Äúthank you‚Äù
- *click*

You may be the only one to call it in, and it could save someone else from a terrible wreck. It could save a life.

Also, there is no need to elaborate any of the information. 911 dispatcher‚Äôs time is very valuable. Keeping it simple is easier for the dispatcher. No need to diatribe or qualify your call. ‚ÄúIm not sure if this is even an emergency‚Äù ‚Äúi was just driving to blah blah and I saw xyz, I had to swerve, etc etc‚Äù ‚Ä¶ leave out comments like that. You‚Äôre already on the phone. They dont care where you are going, or what your opinions are about the object. Just give then the relevant facts they need to find and address the situation. Being as precise as possible with location and simply saying ‚Äúthere is a huge [mattress] in lane 3‚Äù is all they need to pass the emergency along to appropriate authorities.

EDIT: A few of you have relayed bad experiences when calling 911 for road obstructions. Rude dispatchers who tell them ‚Äúcall someone else‚Äù. But it should be noted the overwhelming amount of people on this thread who report being personally thanked by 911 dispatch for reporting dangerous road obstructions. 

It also should be noted the hundreds of examples below of people who have been in or almost been in terrible accidents from swerving around or hitting objects.

Of course, if there is a bumper or tire on the *shoulder* of a freeway, this is probably not a 911 call. This would be a non-emergency. Its still good to report stuff like this to a non-emergency line so it can be cleared from the shoulder. It likely doesn‚Äôt need immediate dispatch though. 

A mattress in the center lane of a 5 lane freeway on the other-hand, is a terribly dangerous situation. 

There is always a level of judgement to be executed when calling 911. Of course, their time is valuable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/12xzhw3/ysk_its_appropriate_to_call_911_for_large_debris/,385

"PSA For Gen-X'ers with parents in nursing homes, with dementia/Alzheimer's.",431,GenX,"Some of us already have parents that are in nursing homes, and a lot of us will have parents in that situation sooner rather than later.  I work in a nursing home specializing in Alzheimer's.  Just wanted share one thing that seems to help my patients.

Set up a routine for visiting and/or calling your parents. If you call after breakfast on a Sunday, try your best to call every Sunday after breakfast.  If you visit, try to visit the same time each week!  If you bring your parent a coffee when visiting, please bring them a coffee each time.  The routine is good for them.  And, please, if you visit regularly and can't make it on your normal day, call the nursing home and let one of us know.  

It helps the residents a lot when they start to miss their family, and I can tell them ""It's Monday.  John is coming after lunch, he's bringing the dog, and I think he's going to bring you a Starbucks!"".  That gives them relief in that moment.  If their son can't come in on their regular day I tell them ""I know John usually visits today, but he has a checkup at the doctors.  He said he's going to call you when he gets out"".  

Also, telling us some things about your parents goes a long way.  Tell us their favorite hobbies, the name of their best friend, their pets names... things like that.  Good nursing home staff will use that information to help the patients.  ""Can you tell me a story about your friend Cindy?"" sometimes gets them talking.

Just wanted to pass that along.... the more you know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/12yqdp7/psa_for_genxers_with_parents_in_nursing_homes/,63
