"Freelance nail artist?",2,"ucr","Hi, I’m a third year at ucr who is passionate about nails. Full disclosure, I’m not a licensed by the state to work in a salon, but I understand lots of girls work from home as freelance nail artists as a side gig without a license. I’ve been having a really hard time getting a part time job in retail or food service, so freelancing would help me out financially and allow me to keep perfecting my craft. I’m a full time undergrad student, so I could only take clients a few times a week at most, and I would charge relatively affordable rates since I’m just starting out. I’m still up in the air about all this, but if anyone has any questions or anything to add feel free to reach out, thank you :)","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12yvh4d/freelance_nail_artist/",0

UCR pros:
• It’s a UC
• I just signed a housing agreement close to the campus
• Close to a full ride

UCR cons and questions:
• They changed my major to Business Economics so I’m also wondering if I’m able to change my major after admission?
• Kinda far from everything but I don’t mind cuz I’ll be driving

CSULB pros:
• Near everything
• Good Marketing program
• Low acceptance rate and kinda cool I got in

CSULB cons:
• Still need to find housing
• Have to pay like extra $4k/semester but will be getting a job there

I submitted an appeal showing them the paid ParkMobile receipt and the time stamp saying I was running late to a discussion I was teaching. Got the appeal back this morning:

Appeal: Denied

"I am a Candidate Running for Internal Affairs : This is my platform and Feel Free to Ask me Anything",18,"ucr","Hello Highlanders!

My name is David Kiroloss and I am one of the candidates that is running to be your Vice President of Campus Internal Affairs! I noticed a lot of students have been on here asking about candidates and what their platforms are so I just wanted to introduce myself and do just that!

To provide a **TLDR** for this post since I do plan on being as thorough as I possibly can, my top four goals for my mission next year is to do the following: 1) Implement a 24/7 communal fridge system to expand food accessibility and combat food insecurity on campus. 2) Establish a Mental Health Awareness committee to ensure information of mental resources (Such as CAPS, CARE, etc.) are being effectively disseminated to students, coordinate peer support group sessions on topics such as academic stress, social stress, etc. to create a sense of community & safe space for students to express themselves, and to direct the members of this committee to go around campus and do something positive for students (like cards of encouragement & snack for students in the library during examination weeks). 3) Create a Discord server that is open to all students to access in order to enable the student body to have a direct line of communication with student leaders. 4) Establish a School Spirit committee to highlight all our amazing individuals, offices, and organizations we have on campus when they succeed, as well as to highlight all the resources & opportunities we have on campus. Feel free to ask my any questions in the comments and make sure when you're at the polls to vote **David Kiroloss** for **VP of Internal Affairs!**  


To start off, I just wanted to provide some background information as to who I am, what I have done while I was in office, and what I have been currently doing on my own time as a Highlander. During my time as a senate intern and senator for BCOE, I have successfully spearheaded the coordination of COVID-19 Supply Distributions, advocated for Academic Accommodations, and advanced efforts for Basic Needs development.

A critical issue that I have noticed during my time in office and out of office is that a lot of students are not aware as to what the office of internal affairs does in our student government structure. So **what is the office of internal affairs? What do they do?** To answer that, at it's core, the Office of Internal Affairs is the Highlander Community. It's focus is to support our students and to better the quality of life on this campus. It's focus is to present student concerns to Administration and develop solutions to these issues. It is the most Vital Office in our student government.

**The structure** of the Office of Internal Affairs is divided into five committees: Basic Needs, Diversity Council, R'Professional Closet, Academic Affairs, and the Sexual Harassment/Assault Prevention Committee.

My platform is to **Bolster Student Affairs.** My mission as VP of Internal Affairs is to better student quality of life by reinforcing current developments in Basic Needs, reinstating the Mental Health Committee, coordinating with student leaders to Identify Concerns, and advocating to enhance Student Quality of Life at our campus.

I know I have stated a lot of buzz words, which is why I would like to use this segment to provide a detailed list of how I plan on accomplishing the above statements. When it comes to **reinforcing current developments in Basic Needs,** I want to direct the committee to expand into other areas of basic needs besides only focusing on food & housing related concerns. In one of my psychology classes, I learned that basic needs also expands into financial security and social well-being, which is why I would like to guide the committee next year to organize financial literacy workshops, conflict de-escalation workshops, and collaborate with the office of financial aid to set days for students to come in and complete their FAFSA applications. Moreover, one of the bigger goals I have for the area of Basic Needs is to **implement a 24/7 Communal Fridge system** around campus in order to expand accessibility to food. Currently, the R'Pantry only has a 9am - 5pm schedule for students to walk in and access food, which I believe is an amazing resource, however, over the years I have heard that it is not the most accessible-friendly system since appointments are booked months in advance. I believe by having communal fridges readily available for students, it would further bolster efforts to minimize food insecurity on our campus. In order to ensure these fridges are stocked with food, I plan on collaborating with the Community R'Garden to utilize the produce that they grow which would support their mission of ensuring students are fed. Moreover, I want to collaborate with our community service organizations on campus to provide them an opportunity to have an impact on our college campus for service hours and to spotlight them when they are stocking these fridges. It's a win for our community service orgs and most importantly, it's a win for our students.

Second, **As VP of Internal Affairs I will** establish a committee in the student government that is dedicated to mental health on our campus. College, is downright stressful. As students, we are entering a period in our lives where we are adulting and we receive stress from different areas, such as academic stress, social stress, financial stress, etc. As an student who is using CAPs for counseling and support, I believe that this resource has helped me develop so much, learn how to cope, and become a better individual. I strongly believe that our student government should have a mental health committee to recognize the importance of mental health and utilize it's platform to ensure information of Campus Mental health resources are being disseminated to students. For as long as I have been around, I hear a lot of times that students do not know how to access CAPS or know that CAPS provides six free therapy sessions to support our students. Moreover, I want this committee to also have a tangible impact on campus. Simply disseminating information is the bare minimum for mental health awareness. I want to utilize this committee to organize set days for students to come in to a safe space and express themselves when it comes to academic stress, social stress, etc. I believe this would bolster our fondness as a community. Lastly, we all have heard the jingle ""Random Acts of Kindness"". I want to direct the members of this committee to go out on campus on a random day and do something nice for our students. In my time as a community service coordinator, I found the events where we made note cards and lunch bags for students when it was examination week to be extremely fulfilling as it made people's day a bit brighter.

Third,  **As VP of Internal Affairs I will** create a mass discord server that is open to the public so that students can directly message student leaders in order to identify student concerns. I believe this will increase accountability & transparency within our student government, as well as provide students with the convenience of voicing their concerns at the drop of a hat. Moreover, another critical issue I have noticed is marketing. The marketing of our student government is not as great as it could be. Having a table set up once a week for students to come to for information is an amazing program they do, but I believe it can be better. A Highlander once expressed this ""Students should not have to approach a table to get information, our student leaders should be approaching us"". I agree with this sentiment. In order to expand awareness of our student government and the events we host, I believe we need to be initiating the conversations and up our marketing game. As someone who has supported marketing for organizations I am affiliated with, I have learned some techniques as to how to effectively approach students. In essence, it ultimately comes down to having a normal conversation and asking if they are aware of x event/program. I will bring the knowledge I have to the table and show my cabinet how to proactively spread information on our campus.

Fourth, **As VP of Internal Affairs I will** work to support our commuter students and do whatever I can to increase their quality of life on this campus. While I was campaigning, a student expressed to me that the RTA Commuter transit bus has limited times where it reaches them and in order to make it to campus on time for their class they have to get up at 6:00 AM. It must be extremely stressful to have to do that everyday and I can empathize, as for one of my extracurricular programs that I am a part of, I have to get up and be at campus by 6:00 AM on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and it sucks. I respect our commuter students for being able to do that everyday. I believe that the student government can do something about this to expand the bus hours in order to provide some form of relief to this issue. Moreover, I know other campuses have fridge lockers for their students to store their food until they want to eat and I want to work with the HUB to implement these lockers for our students.

Fifth, our campus has a whole lot of diversity. We have students from many different backgrounds and as a student government, I believe we should do something to further embrace that diversity. When I was in high school, the student demographic was very similar as we had students from a variety of cultures. One of the things we did to embrace that diversity was that we held a week long event called ""The Multicultural Festival"". It was a wonderful event that we all looked forward to every year. Our school had an assembly and all of our cultural organizations would perform something from their culture during this week. Moreover, there was a day during lunch where all the clubs would bring a dish from their culture and sell it to students to fundraise. As the saying goes, ""Food is a great gateway to learning more about a culture"". **As VP of Internal Affairs, I want** to bring this event that I fondly remember to our campus community. We already have cultural organizations that have culture nights where they perform for their members, it's just a matter of coordinating a day with these amazing orgs. Furthermore, I want to utilize this event to put a spotlight on our ethnic & gender (E&G) programs at Costo Hall to set up a day during that week to host a Costo Hall Fair to increase awareness of our fantastic E&G programs.

Sixth, **as VP of Internal Affairs, I will** expand the R'Professional closet to provide workshops to students on resume building, marketing, email, and interview etiquette. An amazing program that the student government supports is the R'Professional closet which provides students with professional clothing for interviews/formal events. I believe that this is a fantastic program, but I know we can expand it to do much more for our community. If we are going to help students look formal, I believe we should be hosting workshops to show students how to conduct themselves formally to better their chances when it comes to job hunting.

Seventh, **as VP of Internal Affairs, I will** bring more educational resources to campus when it comes to adulting. A resource I heard from the highlander community that would be beneficial is to try and coordinate educational workshops on how to drive, file taxes, etc. As a student that is the son of parents that immigrated to the U.S. from Egypt, it was definitely a struggle to figure out how to be an adult on my own and I know there a lot of students out there that are in a similar boat. I strongly believe that by hosting workshops on topics of adulting will be beneficial for our community.

Finally, **as VP of Internal Affairs, I will** establish a school spirit committee in my office to focus on increasing Highlander spirit. I know we have all heard it time and time again that our school is known as UC Rejects. I believe this connotation of our school is a disservice to the morale and spirit of our exceptional community. This school has provided me and so many students with opportunities to pursue their dreams. We are still young individuals pursuing higher education to better our lives. And at the end of the day, that is all that matters. College is what we make of it, and I believe we should all be proud of ourselves for the trials and tribulations we had to overcome to get to this point in our lives. I do not believe that our campus spirit has to be down in the dumps and I do not believe we should be disappointed or ashamed to be Highlanders. We might not be as privileged as the students of UCLA or UC Berkely to enroll into a school with an outstanding school spirit & prestige, but I believe that this is an opportunity for our generation to be the ones that raised our school spirit and change the culture of this campus. We can be the individuals who changed the connotation of our school from UC Rejects to UC Resilient. This culture change is an opportunity for us all. It's an opportunity that nobody at any of the other colleges will be able to say they were able to make happen. I hope that **as VP of Internal Affairs**, I can **work tirelessly with everyone** to change campus for the better. With this committee, I want to utilize it to spotlight our highlanders being highlanders, our student orgs doing amazing work, our wonderful offices supporting our community, and showcase the resources & opportunities we have as a campus. On a fun note, I want to utilize this committee to create an event called ""The Highlander Games"" (A student I met today suggested that title to me) where we have an event for students to form teams and compete in some sport/obstacle course in order to fundraise for campus causes.

I do have some more ideas I plan on implementing for next year, but this post has been going on for a bit too long. As an end statement, Internal Affairs begins here, at home, by placing R’Students first and foremost! I am confident in my abilities and as Vice President, students will be R’Priority.  Feel free to ask me any questions! Thank you so much for reading my post to this point, I know it was a lot, but I want to be as transparent & detailed as possible about my platform. I wish you all the best for this Spring Quarter, go get that 4.0 GPA in the bag! :)","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12rwvih/i_am_a_candidate_running_for_internal_affairs/",11

"Grad Fair nonsense",57,"ucr","Hi guys, here’s a cute little map I drew to help clarify the grad fair stuff. I don’t have any friends who have done this (like many of us) and I didn’t go to the grad workshops (like most of us although I heard they wouldn’t have helped for today anyway) and I was overwhelmed with the chaos and disorder of the grad fair. I have horrible handwriting and I’m not an art major okay but I hope I can help. 

So you enter through the bookstore door and to your left where you typically pick up online orders is where you buy your cap/gown/tassel. But the line is not clearly marked and snakes through the clothing racks (because why would they have been so intelligent as to moving the clothing racks before this chaos?🙄). 

When you walk inside, you’ll see the mannequins and the center tables with yellow and blue UCR sweatshirts in the center of the store. The line starts around there and curves back towards the left, kinda in a random spot in the center of the basketball shorts and sweatshirts. 

Make a buddy in line because: when you wrap around to the area with the sashes, instead of intelligently having them available at the same counter where you get your cap & gown, you have to hop out of line to spend time choosing your sash, diploma frame, sash frame, leather diploma book holder thingy, and thank you notes. But if you leave the line, you can potentially lose the spot you just held for the last 2.5hrs. So, make a buddy to have them hold your spot for you. 

There’s a few different sashes: 

1. There’s the one with our tartan that says “class of 2023” on one side and (I believe) has the UCR seal on the other side. It’s like a *cottony material. It’s $50.*

2. There’s a *satin sash* with “class of 2023” on one side and the UCR seal on the other. *That is $50.* 

3. There’s a *satin sash* with “class of 2023” on one side and “first generation” on the other. *That one is $50.*

4. There is a *dark blue velvet sash* with “class of 2023” on one side and the UCR seal on the other side. It is in a *plastic rolled tube and it is $80.* 

5. There is a *bright yellow velvet sash* with “class of 2023” on one side and the UCR seal on the other. It is *also in a plastic tube and it is $80.* 

There wasn’t a price on the leather diploma holders. 

There’s a few different types of frames, ranging from $165 as the cheapest and $265? Or a little more as the most expensive. They’re very pretty and tempting to buy but you gotta think if/where you’re gonna hang your diploma up. It’s super cool and I wanted to get one but I also am like I’m really done with this place and don’t care about hanging up my diploma right now🤷🏼‍♀️. But that’s just me. 

But the sash, diploma leather holder, and diploma frames all gotta be chosen while you’re moving in line next to the notebooks and near the textbook pickup in the back of the store, while the line is still moving to get your cap & gown. Super unplanned and disorganized, I know.

On the right side of the store is random shit. You can get a cord for a $23 donation which is cool.

***There’s also pictures so don’t be like me and not brush your hair thinking a bun is acceptable because they don’t have a brush! These are the “official” grad pictures where you can add them to LinkedIn and shit. ***

Sorry for the lengthy post. I wish there would’ve been some heads up as to what was going on today and how things would be organized. It’s shitty that they have the sash and diploma stuff as a quick grab & go item when it should not be. I just wanted to provide some ahead of time info because I wish I could’ve had some.

I'm not sure what the process is to requesting the minor and how difficult is it to do so. I took math 9A and math 9b and received a B in both. Are these grades okay if I do want to pursue a minor in CS, or not good enough?

Also, I'm in my 2nd year, going into my 3rd soon so am I too late to try and take all the classes required?

Lastly, how difficult are the CS courses? How badly will I struggle if I have to take relatively difficult BIO courses such as CHEM and PHYS alongside these classes.

"Seeking Guidance and Information",3,"ucr","Hello everyone!

I'm hoping that someone can help me out in my search here and maybe provide some information with regard to my situation at the present.

Long story short, I was supposed to graduate this quarter with a Bachelor's in Political Science/Public Service, but the internship that I was supposed to be taking this quarter completely botched communication with both me and the department at large, so it fell through. As a result, I've had to change my major to general Political Science and am now in need of a four-unit course to graduate. I'm currently taking two classes, both on Mondays and Wednesdays, one from 12:30 pm to 1:50 pm and the other from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, and discussions on Monday from 9 am to 9:50 am and Thursday from 3:30 pm to 4:20 pm. Given this schedule, I have two questions. 

It would appear that Professor Nemati has a few slots open in PBPL 132. Is anyone taking that course and have his office hours information handy so I can stop by and discuss this with him? If not, does anyone have any course recommendations that I should look into joining?

Any and all help on this would be greatly appreciated.

Asking as someone not interested much in classical music, but more so in jazz and ""world music"" traditions.

I got in as a transfer with regents, transferring from UC Berkeley (withdrew from Cal 6 years ago). 

Berkeley's music department doesn't appeal to me that much because it seems really classical-focused. Would anyone be able to compare or speak to strengths / weaknesses of the UCR music dept?

"The trees…",25,"ucr","Ok ok I’ve heard so many people complain about the ~cum~ trees at UCR. Are they really that bad?(MY OVERALL QUESTIONS AT BOTTOM)

———————————————————————————

I went to Highlander day and I thought the tree were relatively ok. Like ofc they smelled when I was near them (esp near the med school). It wasn’t as pervasive in other spots tho. I was already reading of the complaints on the subreddit so it caused me to be more conscious of the smells. My mom didn’t even realize there was a smell. Although I was wearing a leather jacket that day and today I was going to wear the same one. However to my dismay I noticed my outfit smelled… off. I couldn’t tell what it was at first but then realized my leather jacket smells like those trees.

I’m hoping it wears off because my hometown does not have those trees lol. However, at UCR does all your clothing smell like that? I’m hoping not and that it usually it doesn’t. Since at highlander day you are outside the whole day (for the most part) so it’s probably not comparable to a regular day for a student (I assume students stick inside more often).

In addition, even if it smells, usually continuous stimuli (like a certain smell) is usually subdued by your brain anyway. Like you usually can’t smell your own scent. Sorry if that last part didn’t make sense this is what I’m referring to -> “Olfactory fatigue, also known as noseblindness, is the temporary, normal inability to distinguish a particular odor after a prolonged exposure to that airborne compound.”

———————————————————————————

Anyways in summary:
- Does the smell usually stay on your clothes?
- Do you notice throughout the day that the
   smell is there (on your clothes or outside)?
- Does the smell concern you that badly?


Thank you so much for reading through this!

Like this is the only thing that I am concerned about location-wise.

———————————————————————————

Edit:

Ok thank you all for answering my post! The main points that I got were mainly:

- No the smell is not as bad as some people make it out to be

- the trees could even be avoided (that’s not necessary but a good point)

- it can be more present during certain times (like it might be worse when it blooms or is hot outside)

- the smell usually doesn’t stay on clothes

- to complain ab the trees is just a joke/meme

- not letting it affect my college decision heavily
     (Yeah the trees are not that important. I already live to a tree which I am really allergic to and am fine. Based on the stuff I already know ab UCR versus my other options, I like UCR the most but there’s still info I don’t know. I just have a few things I need to research like what research professors are doing so I can get a very very rough idea of what opportunities I would be interested in, what clinical experiences I can get/are most popular I am going to email some med orgs ab this, etc.)

UCSC - it’s the closest to Silicon Valley so more job opportunities, also I really like the nature vibe of the campus.

UCR - cheapest housing out of all three schools and also I got regents scholarship would should help me get classes easier.

SDSU - can live at home saving money in the process, already have lots of friends who go here.

You all have such impactful stories that help me understand the vibe of the schools.. and I just wanna say.. thank you, please keep commenting I read everyone <3

Hi, so I know you guys were probably flooded with 
these questions a few weeks ago..

The issue is that I am seriously considering UC Riverside right now! I was going to go with UCSC but the youtube vlogs of UCR make me think that this place seems really chill! UCSC is nice and all but the housing.. and vibes just throw me off.

I got into both undeclared, I’m waiting on three waitlists ( i would go and pay the deposit again if they got to me ) They’re all three schools I would consider.

But I feel like I’m leaning towards the engineering or environmental engineering track. I just wanna study like Elle Woods :)

What are some pros and cons?

I love to work out, I swim an hour of cardio and an hour or so of weightlifting 3 days/week
And I’d prefer it be balls hot than balls cold because I get sick easily! 

I love Vietnamese culture and food, but UCSC definitely doesn’t have that. But the VSA does seem cool! 
I really like being around other asian students just to know that we share a sense of community. I’m part of the LGBTQ community so I’d like to know how diversity is approached on campus!

I wanna eventually learn to cook but I have a feeling I’ll need the first semester to get my shit together.. and I’m kind of excited to have a roommate.

I also know that the housing is pretty godawful in UCSC and UCR ain’t that bad? I hear the area is really quiet but the housing is well priced. Also I just wanna say every post on r/UCSC is about housing or finding a roommate.. 

I’ve watched countless videos and while I wait for your replies I’ll watch countless more. Thank you for your time my possible? upperclassmen :) i know you’re busy and take time out of your day to reply to this sub!

I know this might be annoying but I’m seriously considering Riverside, even though its been like four weeks since my financial aid package should be coming in.. EDIT : 13.5kish compared to 7k at UCSC","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12hm0xx/ucsc_v_ucr_pros_and_cons/",33

Retired regional economist [John Husing ](http://www.johnhusing.com/)said in an interview that UC Riverside has been largely absent from discussions on the Inland Empire’s economy.

The university’s association with Beacon Economics had “defaced” its academic credibility and the decision to sever the relationship was “long overdue,” said Dylan Rodriguez, a media studies professor at UC Riverside and former chair of UC Riverside’s Faculty Senate who helped to circulate the faculty letter.

“UCR should not be applauded for ending the relationship with Beacon, it should be asked whether and how it will attempt to address and repair the damage that \[the\] relationship has already caused to \[the\] university’s research reputation..:

"pros of ucr",23,"ucr","as some of you are deciding between schools hopefully the community of r/ucr and me can help you out with the pros
i’m finishing off of my first year i realized a couple things 
1. ucr is diverse and rated number 1 in social mobility 
2. lots of opportunities to get involved (frats, culture clubs, club athletics)
3. has the largest src (gym) among all the other ucs (my favorite reason)
4. dorms are doable and is better than most campuses
5. in my opinion the campus has a modern design which i like a lot
6. no need for bikes or scooters to navigate through campus/ pretty small compare to other ucs
7. amazing professors (school of business/ CHASS)
8. i’m not sure if other ucs have this but nearly the entire campus runs on solar power
9. avocado, orange, and pomegranate trees
10. amazing concerts and events hosted by aspb and residential halls 
11. lots of support for minority groups (cultural offices, the well, CAPS, basic needs) — other ucs have the same offices but i’ve heard a lot of my friends from other schools say they’re not always active and since it’s overpopulated it takes a while for them to get to you

if i missed anything please write more.. i hope this helps to any students that are struggling to decide which school they want to go","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12g7698/pros_of_ucr/",7

I've visited both campuses and am equally happy. I know nothing about the classes, professors, curriculum, the details. Both are basically equidistant from where I live. Money is not a problem. Culture and social activity is important to me, but not the most important. Good professors and classes are important. 

My main goal is to just get a good job (preferably in SoCal) after college and start working. Idgaf about higher education.

"Opinions on Linguistics / Russian Studies programs at UCR?",1,"ucr","Good evening,

I am a high school student who will be applying to UC Riverside later on this year for Linguistics and I would like to hear from some current undergraduates or alumni what they think of the program at UCR. I've researched this school rather thoroughly, and I've looked through the UCR website and the Comparative Literature and Linguistics pages on the UCR website. I'd like to hear more personal accounts on the major and the experience from students, though.

&#x200B;

I am also conflicted as to whether I should take Russian Studies as a double major or a minor. I believe a lot of the graduation requirements overlap to an extent, and therefore should I just go on ahead and take a double-major and kill two birds with one stone or would it be too difficult? 

&#x200B;

I don't think it would be too difficult to do the Russian Studies double major, as I can already speak two Slavic languages (Serbo-Croatian, Polish), already have a basic understanding of Russian, and have a huge interest in history. Therefore, I don't think the workload would be too much on me (I hope?).

&#x200B;

Career-wise I'd like to probably become a language teacher, either teaching English abroad or teaching Russian through a school/other.

&#x200B;

"Creative Writing minor",0,"ucr","Hi r/UCR, I’m a high school senior who was admitted to UCR for Fall 2023 to major in computer science.

However, I’ve been considering a minor in creative writing, something that deviates from STEM. This is to maintain my interests and give me a creative outlet after mostly learning about computers all day. I’m still thinking about it, and I wanted to come here for advice.

Firstly, please don’t tell me that a minor in creative writing is “useless”. I want to have something in my college years that isn’t pure math and computers, and I understand that those who study art are often looked down upon (for stupid reasons). Plus, it’s only a minor. 

Obviously, pursuing anything in college is a lot of work. But, relative to a major, how much work is a minor? Generally speaking, is it classes everyday? 

For those who have studied (or are currently studying) creative writing or something related, whether as a major or minor, how was it? Did you enjoy the experience? Is the extra work worth it?

I was actually debating between switching my major to Pre-Business instead of Psych, but thought maybe it would be simpler just to minor in Business instead because math is not really my strongsuit?

"How is premed here?",1,"ucr","I'm very seriously considering going to UCR, and since I also want to go down the premed route, I have some questions about how premed is here.

1. Are there a lot of premed students? Like, is it harder to build relationships with your profs or join their labs because of the competition? 

2. How are the clinical opportunities here? I've heard that UCR is better than most colleges with getting good opportunities, but is it super competitive to get them/are there lots of applicants for the same positions?

3. Is the grading curve really terrible, or can you generally study your way around it?","https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/12el98d/how_is_premed_here/",2

For seniors graduating in CNAS, do you feel like the 2 years of online class has helped you raise your GPA, or were classes on Zoom maybe your downfall?

I’m curious since honors cutoffs are not official as of yet. Spring 2023 cutoffs are not based off of last year, but rather the graduating class of 2023, which hasn’t been calculated as of yet.

It could either stay the same or change! Keep your hopes up if that might fit you!

I am the quiet type who doesn't typically say hello to people, but when I do, it just turns into small talk and we never speak again. I never had someone try to have small talk with me by making the first move. All my life, I was never the popular, bubbly person who kept up with the trends. I have a naked face (no makeup) and wear just any t-shirt, tank top, or sweatshirt with either shorts or jeans that dont fit the popular ""aesthetic"". I was just never interested; it wasn't me. I consider myself to look moderately attractive, but its almost like the bubbly/extroverted people or the people in more expensive/trendy clothing walk past me or look at me like I'm beneath them or something. Maybe its all in my head but thats how Ive always felt I was treated. I want to know what makes someone look unapproachable?

"Niche Pros of UCR?",16,"ucr","Hi I’m considering UCR for college but I’m torn between UCR and CSULB. 

UCR is giving me the major I want to to (microbiology) but CSULB is only giving me pre-bio and that too in a major I don’t really want to do (molecular biology). 

However, CSULB has a lot of niche cool things like a free gym, lots of on campus student stores, lots of activities, on-site campus emergency buttons. Overall, I really like it even tho it’s a commute college cuz I like the walk and it’s cheaper than UCR. 

That being said, UCR is the better school. After all, it is a UC.

"UCR Incoming First Year Question",0,"ucr","Hi y’all! I’m currently admitted to UCR as a business admin major :) I haven’t heard the best reviews about the business admin program. My dream is to work at FAANG as a product manager. I was thinking of either minoring in Comp Sci while majoring in Business admin or double majoring in Business Admin and Data Science to give my resume a better standing. 
Please give me any advice on how to best prepare myself for this role early on: 
How can I network? 
What campus organizations should I get involved in? 
Should I try switching to CSBA major after May 1st? (Tried switching a couple of days ago and got rejected but I am planning on doing it again after May 1st for a better chance)
What are your experiences with the business admin major at UCR? 
Should I get involved in comp sci related clubs/organizations as well? 
Does FAANG provide entry level jobs to UCR business admin majors? 

Additionally I got invited to honors college and I’m going to pursue it if I get in (I’ve always wanted to graduate a university with honors) . 
I was planning on joining one business club, one comp sci club, and one fun club (boxing or Afsana seem interesting).
I’m definitely going to pursue a masters in comp sci and an MBA.
I’m planning on doing a study abroad over the summer if possible and doing an internship every summer.

Dear Students.

I am hoping to find a Spanish speaking student to help me with my (very) beginner Spanish conversation practice. To be clear, the candidate does not have to prepare anything. They just need to echo back my words with the correct pronunciation, and point out grammatical mistakes etcI envision 2 to 4 hours a week, paying $20 an hour cash.T he job could last all quarter (But I reserved the right to quit!)(in practice, most of the ""hours"" will be less than an full hour, I will still pay $20)It is hard for me to have fixed hours, so this would suit someone that is on campus a lot anyway, and has some flexibility.If you are interested, drop me an email, noting your time constraints if any (only available early,  only available lunch time etc).many thankseamonn

"Portable spa permit help?",3,"Riverside","Hello everyone, I hope this is okay to post here. If not let me know and I'll delete. I have a pretty specific problem and because the county is so unhelpful I thought I might try my luck with the community.

So I live in the area and have been trying to get a portable spa permit for over 6 months. Most of the communication has been done through ""corrections"" on the website, however I was in correspondence with the one only helpful person there for a while. The correspondence stopped since the building and safety plan check had to be done by a different person and because of that I feel like we're back at square one again.

Here's the problem. Since the beginning they were under the impression we were trying to get an in-ground spa, I guess, so we kept getting hit with roadblocks that don't apply to us. Finally, when talking to the helpful person, they actually asked me what we were trying to do and I said we want a portable spa. They said ok, this is all we need from you then! And I provided the necessary documents that they said were approved. Fencing, electrical, location of the spa, certificate of product compliance for the spa cover, etc.

Now, someone else for the building and safety plan check is asking for things I don't even understand. It leads me to believe they do not know this is for a portable spa, even though the description on the permit application states this. This was in their document of corrections to be made:

""If pool cover is installed \*\*\* Must provide pictures with the spa cover (this was not in the Owner’s Manual spec sheet), and the Tag on the spa. The Tag must indicate that it is ASTM-F2286-05 listed.

(the “Certificate of Product Compliance” is not applicable)

Show conductor size, amp, length, and overcurrent protection device for all electric supplied devices.""

What is ""the Tag"" on the spa? And if this was necessary to provide, why didn't the helpful person ask for it? Why now is the certificate of product compliance not applicable?

As for the request for the other request, we provided all the necessary info for the electric.

I'm at my wits end with this process. I was wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience with this and could offer some insight. Visits to the office were unsuccessful as no one seems to be able to help us there, they just tell us to continue the process online.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/12y0cdg/portable_spa_permit_help/",11

"QUESTION: SoCal infrastructure?",10,"Riverside","How are we going to accommodate so many masses of people who lives in high concentrations in Southern California? I drive everyday and am out on the road from sun up til down pretty much and local to these high concentrated areas: LA, OC, SB, Riverside ETC. (not that the whole cities are like this within these counties but feels as those a majority of the cities in these counties have areas that are densely packed) 

I have seen so many apartment complex built in the last 10 years that take up little space yet house so many persons/bodies within those small structures, which also comes along with numerous amount of vehicles for each person residing in apartment complexes and the like. 

Each day I go out it’s different on the road but I feel as though for a majority of the time traffic does it best to move along but there are so many cars on the road that just makes traffic because light cycles literally cannot keep it broken up. It can be a green light for so long but there are just masses of cars that it seems to be intersection blocked on like 30% of street lights I pass through. 

Is our road infrastructure really going to be able to continue to support the mass urban growth which is highly concentrated to certain areas? I see this happening everywhere and it’s not that a lot of people are an issue yet it feels so crowded in specific parts of Southern California because of how densely packed in they are living together work somewhere every day to our and war to go places that congests areas more I believe than if people just lived in a traditional house. I feel as thought bugging the traditional single story 3 BR is impossible here right now as well because it’s so damn expensive.  

On top of all this I am also wondering how there are days in the week that traffic is so congested at 12pm already and that you couldn’t tell the difference between Friday and Saturday traffic to a Monday or Tuesday traffic. What are all of these people doing out on the road, what about work/school?

Before I even got my renewal. I had decided to move out. 
Anyways I’m just posting here to say don’t move to the Trails at canyon crest. It is advertised as a LUXURY apartment with amenities but they don’t have anything. The complex is covered in dog shit and frequently the trash gets over filled and it takes them DAYS to to take care of it. I pay about $40-50 for trash every month. The price of trash changes and the leasing office said it’s due to the amount of units they have rented out. So if more units are occupied you pay less. If less are occupied you pay more. 

Cars & garages are constantly broken into and the security they have only stops once at around 10pm does one quick drive and leaves. And I don’t think they come every night.","https://www.reddit.com/gallery/10zrmrb",5

"RIVERSIDE HUMANE SOCIETY IS NOT HUMANE WHATSOEVER! THEY ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE!",24,"Riverside"," I need to express my experience with the Riverside humane society. I dropped off a beautiful German Shepard on Saturday January 21st. I heard of the outbreak so I went back to get Charley (that's what we named him) January 26th to Foster him. Well they deemed him aggressive and a bitter. He was not like that when I dropped him off. I had to show the workers how he was with me. I got approval to take him but I was told that he has to be neutered first. I would pick him up on the 27th. Well on that same day of the 26th they called me and said I can pick charley up he is ready to go. So they basically rushed a neuter job and had me pick up a very sick dog, No Medication no nothing. I took him home where he was happy and comfortable thinking the anesthesia was making him off. No he was unresponsive Friday morning at 7:20 am. The HS was not open and I took him to my vet and they said it was too late. His lungs were full of blood there and he passed. I called the humane society and spoke with Candi the adoption director. She advised me to take the body to the shelter. I had already paid for a cremation. She told me that they need to do an autopsy. Later that day Candi called me and said that he has the StrEp Zoo diseases and that they had all the samples they needed to send off to the lab and that I can come pick up the remains and have him cremated. That she isn't supposed to let me do that but she would make an exception. I went back on Saturday January 28th and all the staff there would not let me have the remains and Candi was MIA at this point. They told me due to ""legal reasons"" I called Candi several times and not one courtesy call back. I'm so upset about this entire situation. He was so special and loving I wanted to give him a chance to find a home with a large yard he loved to play in and my home is too small. Had I known that he was giving that staff a hard time I would have picked him up sooner. I specifically asked when I dropped him off if he gives you trouble please contact me. No one ever did. Now Charley is disposed of like trash. How Humane is that? I tried contacting the county and the mayors office and no one cares. Charley never got a chance.

"2023/24 Heatwave Outlook",33,"Riverside"," The last 3 years, including this winter were supposed to be cooler than average on Earth. That is because the ENSO cycle was in a rare triple year cool phase. Yet even with that being true 2020 tied with 2016 for the hottest year on record, 2021 was the 6th hottest, and 2022 was the 4th hottest. 

Starting in 2023 we will no longer be in the cool phase. Which could cause a significant change in heatwave severity. 

The transition in the ENSO cycle will likely be leaning towards the warm phase based on several newer measurements that have come out in the last few weeks. This will likely result in a rapid transition in temperature.

Here is a resource for historical ENSO records, as well as heat maps of California during previous moderate heatwaves. These maps show a typical consistent heat pattern across CA. 

Note that several of the hottest cities on this map have in the past reached temperatures as high as 120F or more. Unfortunately we are expecting records to be broken within the coming years. 

The hottest cities annually are already listed as the top 5 hottest in the State.

1: Bakersfield 

2: Fresno

3: Redding

4: Stockton

5: Sacramento 

This post is only intended to help keep people prepared. The reality is winter is the best time to prepare for this. For example, AC prices tend to be cheaper in winter if you need one replaced, additionally burn permits for brush clearing are usually only allowed during the wet seasons.

Preparation can come in many forms. Whether that is by doing maintenance/repairs to your AC, shading windows, getting a generator, planning trips somewhere cooler during heatwaves, or brush cleanup. There are concerns about future rolling blackouts during heatwaves. 

Especially in certain parts of the Central Valley where much of the extreme heat is felt further from coastal cooling and there is a dependence on hydroelectric dams, which are beginning to run dry. Many of those areas do not cool down much at night during summer. Houses can also hold onto heat in their walls and radiate it back into the house at night. The human body needs opportunities to recover from heat. We are also concerned about an increased fire risk that could result from hotter summer temperatures drying out regions, especially in the sierra foothills. 

We understand many may be skeptical of an increased heat risk, or maybe they do not understand our intention to help. 

Please be open minded about at least the facts. All information provided in this post was found through public weather records. We did not create these lists or heat maps. Feel free to do your own research. We will re-post this in communities that we believe may benefit from being informed. Take care.

"Question to the many, many people here who walk their dogs and bring them in public parks and businesses with no leash-",12,"Riverside","Are you stupid, lazy, or do you think the world starts and stops just for you? 

First of all, having your dog on a leash anywhere in county with the exception of a few designated areas, is the law and refusal to obey it can result in a fine of a few hundred dollars. 

Second, what is the point? Are you too lazy to hold a leash or too stupid to figure out how leads and harnesses work? What do you have to gain by doing this? Are you just showing off? Showing off what? Your lack of regard for other people and other animals in public space? 

All you’re doing is opening up the possibility to conflict and tragedy. As good as you think your dog might be, that is still an animal with deep seeded biological instincts to do things like run and chase after things like balls, toys, people or children running, and especially other dogs etc. This of course could lead them into oncoming traffic- an event I witnessed here in town not once but twice in the past couple of weeks. 

And as a dog owner, you should know that unleaded dogs running up to leashed dogs- aka dogs who are being handled intelligently and properly by their owners- can cause that leashed dog stress and cause them to become more aggressive than they may usually be. That being said, as you’re in public, you don’t know what the temperament of any other dog may be to begin with. 

Other dogs might be the least of your problems. Not all people are comfortable with dogs, and this is Riverside/the IE- if your dog runs up to the wrong person, regardless of how it’s behaving it could mean bad news for them or you one way or another. 

Put a leash on your dog. If you don’t, you’re a moron and you deserve the worst.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/107whpy/question_to_the_many_many_people_here_who_walk/",17

Just completed this landscape rehaul project in my relative's yard in Grand Terrace. Stripped out all the water-guzzling grass and replaced it with mulch, gravel, and a stock of 100% native plants like Black Sage, Toyon, Bush Monkeyflower, Manzanitas, Yarrow, California Lilacs, Coyote Brush, Buckwheat, and Penstemons. I can't wait to see them all grow in.

Better drainage, lower water bill, turf rebate $$$, pollinator friendly, colorful, fragrant, beautiful! (in my humble opinion)

"Landlord not providing heat question",17,"Riverside","Had SoCal come turn gas on today. The heater is the only gas appliance in the apartment. The fire box has a crack so the gas man said we need it fixed before we can light it and start using our heater. I let my property manager know and she said she will not be fixing it and to get a space heater. 

This sounds illegal to me, but I'm not sure. 

This apartment is a slum and you have to pick your battles, so we will just use space heaters. I think at the very least the landlord needs to pay the $25 service fee for turning the gas on and off. (Our electric bill is going to be way higher than gas would be for heat, but whatever....and the cost of buying a space heater should be on them too)

Does anyone know how to go about billing the landlord. Should we just pay $25 less on our next rent check and leave a note that this is why? 

If it is illegal to not fix the heater, does anyone know who we can notify about this?

"Laws against airbnbs?",16,"Riverside","Curious if there’s any local political discussion on banning airbnbs in riverside. They are inherently damaging to neighborhoods. Quiet residential areas can overnight turn into an unknown turnstile of occupants, destroying an element of neighborhoods that is so valuable.  Parking, noise, and the general lack of neighbor continuity in a neighborhood are all at risk when an airbnb is on your street/neighborhood. 

These short term rentals damage both renters and potential home buyers. By radically reducing inventory the supply for both rentals and potential homes to purchase plummets. This causes rent and home prices become unaffordable to everyone. 


I know other cities have made laws to ban short term rentals so I’m curious if anyone knows if this is on riverside’s radar.

The cop told me that I'm gonna get a court in the mail with the bill I think he said it's gonna be around 300 and to do traffic school to get rid of the point. 

The citation says that I have to appear in court the day before Christmas eve. Is this where I get to plead guilty/not guilty? The bottom of the paper says that I have options.

The weather is getting nicer and it's such a shame, and just not fair, that we can't enjoy our day or sleep with the windows open. 

I've tried calling the Riverside police non emergency number.  I've never seen them check on her. 

What can I do? 

Some things I've thought of, but I'm not sure how or if it will even help. 

Find out who her landlord is and let them know. It's not an apartment complex where it's easy to contact the property manager. It's a house with 2 or 3 units. How do I find the owner? I've tried Google, with no success. 

Send a petition around the neighborhood, collect a few signatures, and give it to the police? I don't even know if this would work. I just don't know what else to do. 

She's absolutely on drugs. But she's using them in her own home. Is that even a crime that the police care about?

We run fans and have a white noise machine, but still can't drown her out.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/y2f3ol/help_dealing_with_screaming_lady/",18

## · Swimwear

· Many waterparks have a particular dress code for swimwear. There might also be some additional rules regarding zippers, metal ornaments, buttons, belts, etc. That’s why make sure your swimsuit is in the clear and checks it out of the list.

## · Coverups & sun protection

· Did you forget them? Good thing you read this point. Don’t forget to bring a full sleeve coverup and sunscreen to protect you from the harsh rays of the sun when you are done with the water slides.

## · Waterproof camera

· You won’t be able to record any memories if you don’t have a waterproof camera. Make sure you have one or you can even borrow it from your friends if they have one.

## · Towels

· Towels come in very handy when you want to dry off and walk around, or when you want to change on dry clothes. Although they are available at every [**Irvine water park**](https://wildrivers.com/about/) in case you forgot.

## · Travel-sized shampoo and soap

"Any deaf families with kids open to playdates? Any social gatherings for ASL users?",29,"Riverside","My wife and I, along with 3 kids (all boys 9,4, and 2) moved out to Riverside a few months ago shortly after learning that our 2-year-old, who was born with CHARGE syndrome, was fully deaf and would only ever be able to communicate by learning ASL.  (Everyone else in the family is hearing.)  We came out here to get our youngest enrolled in the infant program at California School for the Deaf in Riverside so he can be around some native ASL speakers and other kiddos learning to sign.  We got him enrolled but after a couple of days, we were informed that, because he has an extra disability (trach, g-tube, etc.) that he cannot attend CSDR.  

We are heartbroken as we believe we need to get ourselves around people who use ASL fluently so he has his best shot at learning language during his early years.  We have been learning ASL, but are obviously not fluent as we only learned hearing wasn't an option for our kiddo when he was about 1 year old.  

So, we are not giving up trying to get our kid absorbed in ASL.  We want him to have every chance to acquire and use language.  We want to try and socialize with other ASL speakers in the area if there is any interest.  We have been directed to CODIE and another local group or two as well.  We just wanted to see what opportunities are out there since the school for the deaf doesn't seem to be accommodating to deaf+ kiddos. 

Our older boys have been exposed to ASL as well and we'd like to give them an excuse to use it.  The 4-year-old is interested in it but hasn't used it too much, but the 9-year-old has taken lessons and attempts to use it at times to communicate in certain situations.  I think he'd enjoy using some of his knowledge as well.

Thank you for your time!","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/x4ndnd/any_deaf_families_with_kids_open_to_playdates_any/",4

"The State of Homeless Resources in Riverside",32,"Riverside","Since the city and county like to spread misinformation to make it look like they are doing things I figured I would share some information.

Right now resources for unhoused people are functionally non-existent. We have some shelters, but they are often full and don't answer their phones. They are extremely dangerous, especially to women, BIPOC, and LGBTQIA+ people. Possessions are constantly getting stolen and storage is limited to non-existent. They are mostly warehouse style making the spread of disease common, Path of life just reopened after quarantining due to a covid outbreak. They are also time limited with people being sent back to the streets after 60-90 days or if they miss curfew more than twice. Most additional housing is a year+ away from being built and often restricts who can access it.

There is a housing voucher program but the wait list is long, and slow to move. I talked to one person who has been in the same position for over 2 months. In addition the housing vouchers generally only pay between 1200 and 1400 for rent and often only pay for about 2 months. Anyone who takes a look at the cost of renting knows that housing of that price is almost non-existent. Often it uses credit scores, application fees, and security deposits to discriminate. People are not given housing or useful housing lists while they search. People are often unable to leave their possessions without having them stolen making housing searches extremely difficult and risky.

The outreach teams are overloaded and extremely unreliable. People are often dropped off of resource wait-lists because their case managers dropped the ball, or left and nobody took up the case. Outreach teams will often reach out, take a phone number and the person never hears from them. They do a very poor job of communication and so residents who don't have additional advocates or aren't able to self-advocate are often dropped through the cracks.

There has been a push for more carceral attacks through the camping ban, HOME Court, and CARE Court. These programs seek to channel people into our criminal justice system rather than the cheaper and actually effective option of meeting needs. These all have ableism and racism heavily built into them and ignore data driven best practices. For example HOME Court requires people to plead guilty to access it, and CARE Court forces people into guardian programs that strip away autonomy, Brittany Spears is an example of what this looks like, although she had the protection of fame. 

TLDR; Shelters are limited, dangerous, and not a solution. Housing vouchers are all but unusable. Hotel vouchers are nearly non-existent. Outreach teams are overloaded and unreliable. HOME Court and CARE Court and expensive human rights violations.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/wyeyc3/the_state_of_homeless_resources_in_riverside/",39

# Pray for my dying son, not me, father shot in Corona Costco in 2019 told bystander		

 

By [Brian Rokos](https://www.pe.com/author/brian-rokos/) | [brokos@scng.com](mailto:brokos@scng.com) | The Press-Enterprise  
PUBLISHED: August 11, 2022 at 7:00 p.m. | UPDATED: August 12, 2022 at 8:39 a.m.

 

Russell French and his wife, Paola, were shouting in pain after they and their son Kenneth were [shot by off-duty Los Angeles police Officer Salvador Alejandro Sanchez](https://www.pe.com/tag/corona-costco-shooting/) in the Costco in Corona on June 14, 2019.

“My whole side was burning,” French testified on Thursday, Aug. 11, and he saw someone praying over him.

“That’s not a good sign,” French, 61, added matter-of-factly.  Worse, Kenneth was immobile and silent.

“The little energy I had, I was able to move my head. I told him to  pray over Ken,” French told Deputy Attorney General Mike Murphy.

  

French testified about the moments leading up to the gunfire and the  couple’s recovery during the second day of Sanchez’s preliminary hearing  in Superior Court in Riverside.

The day’s testimony concluded with French being cross-examined by  defense attorney Michael D. Schwartz. The hearing is scheduled to resume  at 1:30 p.m. on Monday. Judge Samuel Diaz Jr. will decide whether there  is sufficient evidence to hold Sanchez for trial on charges of  voluntary manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon.

 

Sanchez has pleaded not guilty. He is not in custody.

The state Attorney General’s Office is prosecuting the case after  concluding that Sanchez’s actions as a police officer — shooting Kenneth  French after the 32-year-old struck Sanchez with a blindside,  unprovoked punch — were not reasonable. The Riverside County Grand Jury  had previously declined to indict Sanchez and [District Attorney Mike Hestrin decided not to file charges](https://www.pe.com/2019/09/25/corona-costco-shooting-update-to-come-from-riverside-county-da-this-morning/).

[The LAPD fired Sanchez](https://www.pe.com/2020/06/10/lapd-officer-was-out-of-policy-in-deadly-corona-costco-shooting-la-authorities-say/) after an investigation into his actions. In a civil case, a federal jury in October[ awarded $17 million to Kenneth French’s estate](https://www.pe.com/2021/10/27/jurors-deliver-17-million-verdict-against-ex-lapd-officer-city-of-la-in-corona-costco-shooting-death/) and his parents.

  

[For the second day in a row](https://www.pe.com/2022/08/10/corona-costco-shooter-crumbled-witness-says-as-attorneys-focus-on-his-condition-before-firing/)  Thursday, there was testimony from a witness who said Sanchez believed  that Kenneth French had shot him. But no gun was recovered from French,  who is intellectually disabled, and authorities have said that Sanchez  was the only shooter.

 

Russell French told Murphy that he had just handed his wife, Paola,  62, a sausage sample from a booth in the deli area and walked away.  Kenneth was near the booth as well. The next thing French heard was  someone shouting “police officer” and his wife pleading, “Don’t shoot.”  He then saw someone sitting on the floor pointing a gun at him.

“I said, ‘Don’t shoot. My son is sick,’ and things happened at  lightning speed,” French testified. Suddenly, “We’re all shouting in  pain.”

Sanchez again Thursday sat at the end of the defense table, next to  investigator Bobby Dean, writing notes on a yellow legal pad and  whispering comments to Dean and Schwartz.

French said he lost a gall bladder and kidney to the bullets and  survived by “a half millimeter,” a doctor told him, when a bullet only  grazed his pancreas.

But Russell French testified that he and his wife still suffer from physical and mental wounds.

“We have a policy at home,” he said. “She doesn’t speak pain. I don’t speak pain. Otherwise, we are going to go down together.”

 Samira Shokoor testified she was in the deli when she saw someone  pull a gun out of his shorts pocket as he was falling. She ran when she  heard the first shot.

“I was in disbelief that I was watching someone shooting in Costco,” Shokoor said.

William Gagnon was in the TV section when he heard the shots. He  testified that he walked over to the deli and, seeing four people lying  on the floor, assumed that there had been two shooters. Spotting Sanchez  still holding a gun, Gagnon asked him where the second shooter was.

“He still has a gun,” Gagnon testified that Sanchez told him, pointing toward Kenneth French.

Gagnon went over to French and searched for a gun. He said he could not find one.

Gagnon then held French’s hand until he died.

**RIVERSIDE COUNTY DA MIKE HESTRIN'S ROLE:**

 

# Message to Riv DA Mike Hestrin, Police and Deputies Are Not Above the Law		

  by S.E. Williams -  November 1, 2021  

A compromised leader can ruin the efficacy of the agency he/she is  elected to lead, be damaging  to a community’s trust in the office, and  can often be extremely costly to taxpayers.

This is a lesson both Riverside County residents and Los Angeles  County taxpayers were forced to learn once again on Wednesday, October  28, when a federal jury ordered the city of Los Angeles and a former Los  Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer to pay $17 million in damages  to the family of Kenneth French. 

The 32-year-old mentally disabled man was shot and killed in July  2019, by the off-duty LAPD officer inside a Costco store in the City of  Corona in Riverside County.

This time it is Los Angeles, and not Riverside county taxpayers who  are on the hook for the $17 million, but no taxpayer would ever be  liable if all deputies and police would value human life, stop shooting  people indiscriminately, and stop operating as if, because they wear a  badge, they are above the law. 

 

District attorneys for their part, should stop covering up such  misdeeds by failing to charge officers with crimes when they  inappropriately use excessive force. Afterall, it is not as if such  actions are benign— they too often result in serious injury or death.

District attorney investigations of police shootings often end with  no action being taken against the officer involved. And just as it is  really no secret, sheriff and police unions heavily fund the campaigns  of sheriffs, they also heavily fund the campaigns of district attorneys,  as they did the campaign of Riverside District Attorney Mike Hestrin. 

 It is never surprising when Hestrin, like so many other district  attorneys across the country, refuses to file criminal charges against  an officer nor was it so this time around when the grand jury chose not  to indict and Hestrin declined to file. Grand juries make decisions  based on what evidence is presented to them and in this case with  Hestrin’s office presenting the evidence, is it any wonder the outcome  was—as usual—predictable?   

 

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, however, saw the case  differently and in August charged the now ex-LAPD police officer,  Salvador Sanchez, with voluntary manslaughter and assault with a  semiautomatic firearm. Sanchez was subsequently arrested and is now  awaiting trial.

According to court documents, Sanchez was shopping at the Costco with  his family and holding his 1½ year-old son in his arms in June 2019,  when Kenneth French struck him from behind.

Kenneth’s parents, Russell and Paola French, tried to intervene on  their son’s behalf explaining to the off- duty officer, Sanchez, that  their son was schizophrenic and also had a mental disability. “I begged  and told him not to shoot,” Russell explained to reporters soon after  the 2019 incident, claiming he told Sanchez they were unarmed. “He still  shot.”

 Sanchez shot Russell in the chest and he also lost a kidney. His wife,  Paola, was shot in the back and remained comatose for what was defined  as an extended period. And their son, Kenneth, died after being shot  once in the shoulder and three times in his back. 

 

Sanchez was fired by theLAPD in July 2020 after the Board of Police Commissioners found he had violated LAPD policy.

However, in August 2021, immediately following the grand jury  decision not to recommend charges, DA Hestin proclaimed at a news  conference that he would not charge Sanchez stating, “It’s a difficult  case.”

Obviously, it was, at least for Hestrin anyway, since his office  obviously failed to present compelling enough evidence to the grand jury  for it to recommend charges. Again, not surprising for a District  Attorney like Hestrin whose political fortunes rest with not angering  his police and sheriff union patrons.

 

Obviously, the Los Angeles Police Commissioners and Attorney General  Bonta were able to see what Hestrin chose not to see and instead chose  to hide the grand jurors for cover—that felony charges were indeed  warranted in Sanchez’s use of deadly force against the French family.

As explained by Bonta when he announced the state was pursuing  charges against Sanchez, “Where there’s reason to believe a crime has  been committed, we will seek justice.” According to Bonta, that is  exactly what the Sanchez case is about, “pursuing justice after an  independent and thorough review of the evidence and the law.” 

It is time Riverside County has a District Attorney willing  to do  the same. As Bonta stressed, “\[B\]eing licensed to carry a gun doesn’t  mean you’re not accountable for how you use it. No matter who you are,  nobody is above the law.”

Riverside needs a District Attorney who applies the law equally to everyone—including deputies and police.

Hestrin is continuing to show himself a true, Trump-flavored-Kool-Aid  drinking Republican who not only refused to bring charges in this case.  but was also very vocal about alleged problems with the 2020 election  in true “Big Lie” fashion.

"Sheriff Chad Bianco should apologize to Riverside council member, lawmakers, residents say",45,"Riverside","## A social media post from the Riverside County  sheriff suggested Clarissa Cervantes supported vandalism of a courthouse  and said: “You are lucky we couldn’t arrest you.”

By [David Downey](https://www.pe.com/author/david-downey/) | [ddowney@scng.com](mailto:ddowney@scng.com) | The Press-EnterprisePUBLISHED: August 3, 2022 at 2:39 p.m. | UPDATED: August 5, 2022 at 11:22 a.m.

About 30 people spoke in support of Riverside City Council Member  Clarissa Cervantes at the Tuesday, Aug. 2, council meeting, criticizing  Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco for [suggesting she supported the defacing](https://www.pe.com/2022/08/01/sheriff-chad-bianco-riverside-council-member-clash-over-abortion-protest-arrests-at-courthouse/) of downtown Riverside’s historic courthouse — something Cervantes strongly denies.

**UPDATE (Friday, Aug. 5):** [**Riverside police video backs council member’s account of courthouse vandalism**](https://www.pe.com/2022/08/04/riverside-police-video-backs-council-members-account-of-courthouse-vandalism/)

&#x200B;

State Assembly Members Sabrina Cervantes, Eduardo Garcia and Jose  Medina followed that Wednesday, Aug. 3, by calling upon Bianco to  “retract his false statement” and issue a public apology to Clarissa  Cervantes, who is Sabrina Cervantes’ sister.

“Implying that a local elected leader deserves to be arrested,  without offering any evidence of wrongdoing, is an abuse of power and  offends the American principle of the rule of law,” the lawmakers wrote  in a news release. “It is reprehensible for our county’s chief law  enforcement officer to recklessly publish false and inflammatory  statements that place people in immediate danger and compromise the  safety of fellow elected officials and their families.”

Clarissa Cervantes said she has received hundreds of negative  messages via phone, email and social media in response to Bianco’s post,  and threats to reveal where she lives.

Bianco and the Sheriff’s Department did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.

[In a Facebook post late Saturday, July 30,](https://www.facebook.com/ChadBiancoForSheriff2022)  Bianco wrote in part: “Our downtown courthouse is a beautiful piece of  history and art. When you damage, deface, or destroy property you are no  longer a protester, you are nothing more than a common criminal. Shame  on the Riverside city councilwoman for supporting the defacing of our  courthouse. You are lucky we couldn’t arrest you.”

On Monday, Bianco was in meetings much of the day but wrote in a text  message that he would “not get into the details of the investigation  just because the councilwoman is in damage control mode.”

Sheriff’s Sgt. Edward Soto said Monday that Cervantes was not  arrested because she did not commit vandalism. He added that no apology  would be issued to Cervantes.

Eight people were jailed on suspicion of felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to commit vandalism in connection with the [painting of green handprints on courthouse walls](https://www.pe.com/2022/07/31/5-arrested-after-abortion-rights-activists-paint-front-of-riverside-courthouse/)  and pillars during an abortion rights protest Saturday night, a  Riverside County Sheriff’s Department news release states. Workers tried  to removed the paint, but some handprints remained visible Wednesday on  courthouse pillars and walls.

One of those who spoke at the council meeting was Rosy Cortez, an  artist with Eastside Arthouse who said she was with Cervantes in  downtown when protesters were arrested.

“She was no way involved in the vandalism at the courthouse,” Cortez said.

The artist said she and Cervantes attended the opening of an art  gallery a few blocks away on Saturday, then walked together after the  event and came across the protest as people were being arrested.

“We were there a maximum of two minutes,” Cortez said.

Cervantes said she walked up the steps at the front of the courthouse  to ask a Riverside police sergeant what was happening, and thanked him  for confronting the vandalism, before rejoining her group of friends on  Main Street. She said there is Riverside Police Department body camera  footage that confirms she walked up the steps and had a  less-than-two-minute conversation with the sergeant.

Council Member Jim Perry said that, if there is body camera video and  courthouse video that sheds light on what happened, “we should all be  made aware of what that is.”

Cortez said she was shocked to learn that Bianco implied Cervantes was involved in the protest “because I knew the truth.”

Most who spoke to the council demanded that Bianco issue an apology. A  few said he should step down. One suggested he ought to be recalled  from office.

Riverside resident Sammie Luna-Smith quoted the [law enforcement code of ethics](https://www.theiacp.org/resources/law-enforcement-code-of-ethics) and questioned whether he was upholding it when he “slandered Council Member Cervantes on social media.”

“This is a blatant attack that nobody should ever be subjected to,  especially Clarissa Cervantes, who is a great advocate and leader, for  not only her constituents, but all people,” Luna-Smith told the council.

**Riverside resident Kevin Dawson said he was “appalled” by Bianco’s comment.**

**“It is so unfortunate what he has done,” Dawson said. “It is so unprofessional.”**

**Murrieta resident Brian Nash, a Democratic candidate** [**for the 32nd District state Senate seat**](https://www.pe.com/2022/03/14/heres-whos-on-the-ballot-for-riverside-countys-major-races-in-june-7-election/)**, talked at the podium as if he were speaking directly to Bianco.**

**“What you said about Clarissa isn’t true,” Nash said. “You know it  isn’t true. But it got you the social media engagement you wanted,  right? The bottom feeders from Riverside County and beyond gave you the  loving adoration befitting the rodeo clown — excuse me, sheriff position  you were elected to.”**

**Nash called the sheriff “the epitome of a coward,” and said he would support a recall to oust Bianco from office.**

[City Council Member Gaby Plascencia](https://www.pe.com/2019/11/10/why-riverside-city-councils-diverse-new-members-say-election-is-historic-for-all-of-us/), who in 2019 became the city’s first Latina to serve on the council, also spoke in support of her colleague.

Plascencia said that when people go into politics they know “it’s going to be messy,” but no one deserves to be threatened.

“Let’s be kind to each other,” she said. “It’s not OK for us to feel that we are unsafe.”

To Cervantes, Plascencia said: “You’re not alone. We stand with you.”

**PUBLISHED: August 4, 2022 at 8:08 p.m. | UPDATED: August 5, 2022 at 5:45 p.m.**

 **A Riverside police officer’s description of body camera video appears to at least partly corroborate City Council Member Clarissa Cervantes’ account of what happened the night the historic downtown courthouse was defaced.** 

 

[**Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco**](https://www.pe.com/2022/08/01/sheriff-chad-bianco-riverside-council-member-clash-over-abortion-protest-arrests-at-courthouse/) **has accused Cervantes of backing protesters’ vandalizing of the more-than-century-old regional landmark during an abortion rights rally Saturday night, July 30. Cervantes has denied that and demanded an apology.**

**Speakers at this week’s Riverside City Council meeting, legislators and others echoed her request that the sheriff apologize.**

**Bianco and sheriff’s department spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday, Aug. 3, Thursday, Aug. 4, or Friday, Aug. 5.**

 

**Riverside Police Department spokesperson Officer Ryan Railsback said Thursday that video recorded by police body cameras shows Cervantes arriving at the courthouse after officers responded to the vandalism report, and leaving minutes later after speaking with a sergeant.**

**“It appeared from the camera that she was coming from the direction of the sidewalk,” Railsback said. “She approached him, inquired about what was going on, he answered the question about what was going and it appeared that she left.”**

**The video shows “that she arrived after our officers were on scene,” Railsback said.**

**He said officers assigned to patrol downtown received the call concerning damage at the historic building at 8:20 p.m. Saturday and got there minutes later. After responding, police officers turned the matter over to the Sheriff’s Department, which polices county buildings such as the courthouse.**

**Railsback declined to release the body camera video. The Press-Enterprise on Thursday filed a request with the city through California’s public records law seeking a copy of the video.**

 

**Cervantes, who condemned the defacing, has said she did not participate in the protest and only came across the activity there while walking along the street in front of the courthouse after attending the opening of a downtown art gallery with friends. Cervantes said she arrived at 8:35 p.m. and a friend snapped a photo of her walking up the courthouse steps at that time.**

**Cervantes said she walked up the steps to talk to the sergeant, whom she knew, to find out what was happening, then rejoined her friends and left.**

**Cervantes said she and friends were walking along Main Street because they were headed to** [**W. Wolfskill**](https://www.wwolfskill.com/)**, a bar and restaurant located down the street.**

 

**Late Saturday,** [**Bianco wrote in a social media post**](https://www.facebook.com/ChadBiancoForSheriff2022) **that Cervantes was spotted at the courthouse.**

**“Shame on the Riverside city councilwoman for supporting the defacing of our courthouse,” he wrote. “You are lucky we couldn’t arrest you.”**

**On Wednesday, Aug. 3, three state lawmakers from the Inland area issued a joint statement** [**asking Bianco to publicly apologize to Cervantes**](https://www.pe.com/2022/08/03/lawmakers-residents-want-sheriff-chad-bianco-to-apologize-to-riverside-council-member/)**.**

**Earlier this week, sheriff’s Sgt. Edward Soto wrote in an email that Cervantes was not arrested “because she did not vandalize the building.” Soto also has said no apology would be coming from Bianco. On Monday, Aug. 1, Bianco said in a text message that he could not discuss specifics of the investigation “just because the councilwoman is in damage control mode.”**

**Sheriff’s deputies arrested eight people on suspicion of felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to commit vandalism in connection with the painting of green handprints on courthouse walls and pillars. Workers tried to wash off the paint this week, but could not remove all of it, a court official said.**

**Railsback said the video does not show what occurred during the protest before police arrived.**

"Riverside Anti-Camping Ordiance",63,"Riverside","Last night the Riverside City Council voted 6-1 to criminalize poverty in the form of an anti-camping ordinance. 

Riverside has nowhere near enough shelters or permanent housing for our unhoused residents and those that do exist have significant barriers. They are often dangerous, difficult to access, and at capacity. They are also not a solution, often time limited and kicking people out at the end without any permanent housing. The housing that is available has such long wait lists that people are often kicked off and forced to reapply. The earliest capacity increase is at least a year in the future and it will be nowhere near enough. This is using the numbers from the point in time count which is an underestimate.

Our outreach teams all feature the same police that regularly threaten and traumatize our unhoused residents. This understandably makes residents reluctant to talk to them and even when contact is made residents often get no meaningful help, if there is even follow up. This is in a city where the minimum wage is less than half the living wage.

Knowing this, our city council passed an ordinance making camping in the Santa Ana river bottom illegal. The river provides access to water, shade, and protection from harassment the city has failed to offer. There are extensive communities and support networks for people who have no alternatives. Many are disabled because our current disability laws are so restrictive. 

Their justification is fire risk and danger to emergency responders. What they did not do was anything to mitigate fire risk to either housed residents or river bottom residents. They posted signs warning against open flame, but provided no alternatives. Independent groups like Inland Empire Harm Reduction have provided fire extinguishers, shovels, buckets, gas stoves, and education but the city has done nothing. They have not even required houses along the borders to practice fire safe landscaping. They have not offered safe camping locations where residents could access resources, nor paid residents to clear fuel. They have not worked with residents to create a fire watch. 

They did nothing but criminalize our most vulnerable residents. Their possessions will be destroyed along with the homes and communities they have built. Residents will be forced deeper into the riverbottom and into the city. They will be cut off from what resources they do have. Fires are not prevented but lives are destroyed.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/wfbyj7/riverside_anticamping_ordiance/",116

"California Climate Change Risk VS Refuge Zones (Update #1)",6,"Riverside"," (Update #1) 

\- There has been a dramatic increase in wells running dry in the South East & North West sections of the Central Valley. The ground in certain areas has sunken 10-28 feet due to aquifer depletion. Once this happens the water does not come back underground to that location. Areas in the North West Central Valley that typically get 12.5 inches of rain have only gotten 1.5 inches. The grass in that region did not have enough water to complete their life cycle and dried two months earlier than what typically is expected. The worst areas were in West Shasta County and West Tehama County, but water depletion was observed throughout California interior landscapes.

\- There are emerging implications of the drought as Central Valley farmers leave more than 400k acres empty. Normally vast landscapes of watered crops have a cooling effect on the local climate through evaporation, but this year dry empty fields will likely cause drier air this summer and allow temperatures to get much hotter in the Central Valley, a region which already gets triple digit heat.

\- Due to the water shortages many hydroelectric dams will be unable to operate, which utility companies are warning in advance will cause outages during peak demand in summer. This could be a cascading effect causing a dramatic spike in heatstroke among local residents. Unfortunately we are also predicting a very severe fire season this year, which will also impact both on-grid and off-grid solar for extended periods of time, possibly even months. This combined effect could leave many people running on generators while gas prices are already extremely high.

\- Zone Blue #1 Northern Coastal areas are still predicted to remain most habitable (from Marin County to Del Norte), Coastal Humboldt County and Coastal Del Norte County seem to have the healthiest ecosystems currently out of all samples we have taken. Plant and soil moisture levels are optimal in these locations at the present time even though elsewhere there has been drought degradation in nearly every other region in California. We believe this is likely due to the region's ability to generate its own precipitation from Coastal fog. The mountains seem to do a better job at trapping the coastal air in this region, which allows the clouds to reach dew point after they enter at night and form nighttime drizzle occasionally. This area also benefits from cool ocean air during summer causing evaporation to be slow. The ecological health of this region is the only positive news we have to report during this term.

\- Unfortunately in the Sierra mountain range & the Eastern Mendocino mountain range there has been unprecedented tree die off both from drought and from a snowstorm during winter that caused a build up of heavy snow on branches. This caused drought affected trees to buckle and break during winter. But as the branches and trees dry out during summer it will add to the fuel load during fire season. This alone will increase fire risk. But worse even is that the surviving trees that were damaged heal themselves by increasing resin output. We have measured it this year, and there is significantly increased resin that could cause the trees to become extremely dangerous if they catch on fire, possibly to the point of explosive combustibility. If there are fires on either of these mountain ranges it often causes extended smoke accumulation in the Northern Central Valley which could lead to unsafe air quality for cities such as Redding, Red Bluff, and Chico.

\-The last three years have been La Nina years. Which causes cool surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. This usually creates a cooling effect over the West coast of the US, but unfortunately it has had very little impact at stopping the extreme summer heatwaves which inland California has been experiencing annually. We do worry about how high the temperature could climb once La Nina has finished it's cycle, because this year Earth has reached it's highest CO2 content to date. Additionally La Nina should cause increased precipitation for Northern California, but instead there has been far less.

\-Comments: We are witnessing a rapidly changing climate, and we've been working hard to document as much as possible. We believe that just as inland Southern CA is a desert, inland Northern CA will also soon become a desert. Desertification is happening all around the world right now, and this is where we are observing it happen here. 

\[\[ Original Post below \]\]

For a college project my group spent half the year studying regions in California for their future habitability as climate change progresses.

We researched both on the ground and using public climate and event records.

The regions listed above are 2 high risk land areas and 2 climate refuge land areas.

As simplistic as our presentation is our findings are based on lengthy and rigorous studying. Please be respectful in the comments because I am not going to argue with anyone on here. Often people that dispute the facts are either personally invested in high risk areas or they are climate change deniers. I don't have the patience for either. The reason I'm posting this on reddit is to gather public responses before our presentation.

The purpose of the presentation is to reach out to developers so they can start preparing housing and business in safer locations as the climate crisis continues.

* (High Risk Zone: Red #1) The Central Valley is a low lying flat region. Most of the central valley is going to be high risk, but the highlighted area is of particular concern. In this area high population cities such as Sacramento and Stockton are located. The elevation in Sacramento is 26ft and Stockton is 13ft. When people think of areas impacted by sea level rise, most people think of coastal areas. But the reality is for California most of the land impacted by sea level rise will be the Central Valley region. Most coastal locations in California are situated far enough above sea level to be safe. Los Angeles for example has a elevation of 305ft and will continue to be well above water inundation. Unfortunately for low lying inland cities such as Sacramento, the rise will overwhelm infrastructure. Ground water will likely get pushed up from underground before ocean flooding even arrives. This region is also heavily impacted by wildfire smoke because the central valley acts like a bowl trapping the smoky air in. The region is already known to have some of the worst air quality in the nation, but the increase in wildfires is adding an extra air quality hazard on a regular basis.
* (High Risk Zone: Red #2) The Western facing Sierra foothills is the highest risk wildfire zone in California, and likely the highest risk zone in the United States. The elevation of the sierra foothills is 500 ft - 4000 ft. You may think at those elevations that the climate would feel cooler, but as someone who has a lot of personal experience in this area that is not the case. Unlike the Central Valley, the Sierra Foothills does not have access to the delta breeze, which is a cool coastal wind that provides relief on hot summer days to the Central Valley. Additionally those elevations are not high enough to create a cool summer climate and the added UV impact in this hot climate just makes it sting to be in the sun and heats up houses faster. The air heats quicker at this elevation which causes a larger portion of the day to be hot. 90F in the sun at this elevation often feels worse than 100F in the Central Valley. Las Vegas for example is 2000ft elevation and is the second hottest City in the United States. The summer heat in this region is often underestimated. Wildfire risks here are high. 60 percent of rain in California falls in the Sierras. But it all dumps down within a few winter months and then it quickly gets hot and dry for more than half the year. The high winter precipitation creates a lot of brush that burns. High winter Rainfall and the hot dry summer which has only been getting hotter and drier is why this area is such a fire risk. Additionally the types of vegetation that grows in this region burns hotter than most woods. Not all forests are equal when it comes to fire risk. Unlike coastal California, the humidity inland is vastly reduced and fires thrive in the dry air. Humidity levels in the foothills are often as low as 5% because extra moisture doesn't arrive from the delta breeze. Even after severe wildfires a new wildfire can happen every year due to the dry grasses and the fact that organic matter on the ground takes years to decompose during the extended dry times. This means that even the top soil can burn. Paradise CA and Greenville CA which both completely burned down within the last few years are located in zone Red#2. The cost alone for fire insurance in high wildfire risk zones is around 5-10× more to insure. Which will suppress development for businesses and farms in these areas. All this combined makes the Sierra Foothills area one of the least habitable regions based on our data.
* (Refuge Zone: Blue #1) The Northern California coast has elevated topography that will not be impacted much by sea level rise. Additionally the cool ocean air gets trapped into the coastal region making the air cool and moist. The trees in the coastal belt of far northern California are more likely to moss over than burn. Additionally the coastal winds that move West to East and mountain range shelters the area in from most wildfire smoke even when there are fires blazing inland. This area particularly stands out as a refuge away from extreme heatwaves. For example during the Pacific Heatwave of 2021 Redding CA was nearly 120F while Eureka CA was 65F-70F at the same time. Summers and winters in the area are mild, and as climate change continues this region will likely be one of the most comfortable climates in the United State. We predict this area will soon be a extremely desirable location to live due to the weather. Similar to how Santa Barbara is in present day.
* (Refuge Zone: Blue #2) The high desert region in southern California will be considered a climate change refuge because of the lack of flammable vegetation. Although it does get hot here, as wildfires continue to get worse a new appreciation for desert life will likely arise. Additionally because there is very little forest upwind of this area, wildfire smoke will be less of an issue compared to most other interior regions.

Closing thoughts:

We would like to be a voice of encouragement for developers to utilize these less populated refuge regions in order to prepare the near future population for displacement and climate change related disasters. The only long term cost effective solution is a slow preplanned migration.

There are other risk and refuge locations that we identified in our research, but these are the areas we found to be most significant. We wanted our presentation to be easy to understand as a guide for development.

I’m looking to make music with likeminded people who aren’t perfectionists, but rather free spirits who just want to have a good time making music. I don’t know how to play any instruments, I just play whatever sounds good, which is why my music could benefit from people with more experience, or people with ideas and no experience :).

"Moved from Dallas, TX recently? Would you please share your experience?",11,"Riverside","Hi,
We are a family of 4, with two elementary school aged kids. Currently, we live in Kansas and are planning to move within the next year. We have shortlisted two areas Dallas, TX and Riverside, CA (or may be Jurupa Valley). Few factors important for us are

1. Education/school quality

2. Healthcare (quality and cost of healthcare, plus having to drive within 30 mins for primary care for adults and pediatrician)

3. Suitable for small businesses (we would like to have one in the next 2-4 years)

We have family/relatives in CA, so have been there. Weather and activities wise it's hard to ignore. Cost of living and potential to lesser savings is our main concern. Plus we are not sure how it is for small businesses.

We like Dallas because it has lower cost of living (probably closer to KS), so will be saving more with better taxation. Weather and family activities are a concern there.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/w4zm5k/moved_from_dallas_tx_recently_would_you_please/",47

"Do you think it should be socially accepted to still be living with family or roommates?",23,"Riverside","Simply put, renting is very expensive. This thought occurred to me after my past year trying to date. I understand that having your own apartment or even home is good, but guys and gals try doing their best to not say that they still live with their family or share a room with a few of others. I wish people would accept and comprehend this more.

I've only ever met a handful of guys who claim to live on their own, and when they do (in a condo or even a house), they're either in their late 30s or 40s or receiving very good financial assistance from family.

I'm not sure why the majority of people I've met, both in real life and through dating apps, try to hide the fact that they don't live alone or live with parents or family. I just want to say that this is completely fine and normal, no need to trip about... It should be accepted more.. Especially the early and late 20s folks.

Most likely, I myself don't even see how I could ever afford to buy a house or endure paying a high rent.

I also have to question why everyone assumes I live alone, have my own apartment or house. Even though I previously had my own place, I was barely getting by, I didn't have a life. Now that I share a room, things are a little less difficult and I finally even have time to date. But people from hinge think that everyone must have their own place lol everyone seems to be trying to display that influencer type of life..

Fellow Metrolink riders I'm on a mission to create a redesigned version of Metrolink’s current mobile app. Using the app myself led me to recognize that the app's layout and functionalities could be improved to provide a better user experience. After reading several reviews it was clear to see that others were also unsatisfied with the design of the app. To get a clear understanding of how to redesign the app that best represents what people are looking for I've created a survey to help me understand what users dislike and like about the app. I’ll be looking forward to hearing your thoughts on how we can improve this design.

"Looking to rent backyard space for RV parking.",13,"Riverside","Hi, I am a 28-year-old transfer student coming to UCI in the fall of 2022 and majoring in Computer Science. I am hoping to live in my RV and am looking for a parking space within 45 minutes of driving from UCI, which is most likely to be anywhere in Orange County, Eastvale, Narco, Corona, Chino Hills, Rowland Heights, or even West Covina. My RV is equipped with a 2700 watt solar panel array and was able to run AC 24/7 in remote areas of Riverside. But I need a closer, safer place to attend UCI so I can focus on studying. I can get fresh water from the grocery store. I do not need a hookup of any kind or access to the mailbox. So all I need is a pure parking space. I do not use tobacco or alcohol and listen to music on Airpod. So you should barely notice my existence. I have a stable income of $2600 per month from my rental property in San Jacinto, but after the property tax, repair, property management fee, insurance, etc., it's a bit tight for me to pay tuition plus rent for a bedroom. Plus, I prefer to live in my RV, which I consider my home. I am thinking of paying $200-$300 per month. If anyone is willing to help, please DM me! Again, all I need is a safe, flat parking space that is within 45 minutes of driving from UCI and does have cell phone service.

&#x200B;

RV Length is 27Ft, about 1.5x the length of a Toyota Camry.

"Moving to the Area and Finding Friends?",25,"Riverside","Hi, I imagine similar posts are on here a lot, but I would like to hear opinions of my specific situation. 

I am deciding between moving to the area for a job or staying at home in the south near family and friends for a job.

This area seems to offer a lot including great outdoor opportunities, a lively social scene, great experience in my field, and the opportunity to expand my horizons. 

My main concern would be moving there and becoming isolated. I will be working at UCR. I am 27 years old. I like sports, being outdoors, hiking, canoeing, exploring, chess, billiards, and socially drinking. 

How difficult is it to meet people? How do I get involved? Any specific recommendations based off of my interests? 

I would also like to embrace the arts scene and become involved with things outside of my comfort zone. What are some can't miss options? And where can I meet people with varying interests?

Gressley, who has been an outspoken critic of big-money campaign donations altogether, has also said she won’t accept money from law enforcement groups.  Endorsed by the PE.

"Ideal time to rent apartment?",5,"Riverside","I’m looking to move in to the Riverside area next summer. Had a horrible experience moving into the current city that I’m living in, so I’m hoping to be more proactive this time. Essentially, I had to settle for a less than ideal apartment because all the decent ones had waiting lists for up to 4 months.

I know that rent prices have been crazy lately all across the country and no one can predict the future, but I was hoping to get a feel of what’s out there given that I won’t actually be in the area until next Summer.

Specifically, I’ll be working in Colton (I know, not Riverside but there’s no Colton subreddit!).

Does anyone have apartment recommendations? Obviously, the cheaper the better, but other factors that can affect that would be safety, the community, other perks that y’all can think of. Also, how are the waiting lists looking for these places? Am I being too proactive and should I just swing by this subreddit Januaryish instead ? 

Sorry for the bombardment of questions, but I appreciate y’all.

Thank you!","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/utfr2h/ideal_time_to_rent_apartment/",5

"Property owners under guise of being their own Management company.",2,"Riverside","The property management that manages my trailer park, are the property owners. Talk about motive, these murderers take the cake. Have you ever seen a property owner collecting mail a year after a person is dead? Only when they put a imposter in the home that works for them.
Have you ever seen a property owner preempt your demise to harm you with bodily injury that leads to death? Only when the owners of said property own the management company of many businesses. That's a red flag.
How about discovery in Court? Or by the ppl that said property owners don't divulge a homes pre existing infestation of bed bugs. Motive? It's not only the properties they manage under guise. Everything from auto sales, to bed bug business. Appliances to transportation, all you own these murderers pre screen you for. From imposters of dish network to imposter's of God fearing pastors. This park I live in, I've seen it all. The owners/managers pose a health risk to surrounding communities. By selling infested furniture to unsuspecting VICTIMS. Intent? 50/50 chance the bed bug business they own gets that call.
In the state of California, you don't need a license for a tent and heater, basically under radar to pay taxes on every lump sum of 5000.00  No taxes, IRS, or code enforcement. When the owners of this park prescreen you, it's for all the money they see in you, and boy oh boy. When I was moved in, I seen tent after tent, 7 or more. That's around 35,000.00 untaxed. In less than two months. Motive motive motive. They drive through atleast ten times a day, always in different cars. Motive, to see who visits you...family, nurses, friends. They shopping using the landscapers they employ from the mngt company they own. Pretty strange how the landscapers work after 12 midnight, with keys, no forced entry, the owners have keys. Prescreened & buying a home, paid in full. Said owner meets you on your doorstep with mattress and box springs, no different than owners standing at the dumpsters charging you for something they know is infested, motivated knowing your friend in the park has a big fat Trust fund. Yep, 2 yrs later, that trust fund was milked by the owners intent, motivated by the 15,000.00 their bed bug business took. Don't even live in this park, but plenty of empty homes that the owners still collect mail from. Pensions, fraud, forgery, malicious intent, federal offenses collecting mail from murder victims homes, motive beyond even the worst of serial killers. Once a dog gets the taste of blood, you know the rest. I've been posting this online Facebook, so I know they get every posting. Defamation and slander I've been dying to get slapped with a lawsuit. No serial murderer is gonna sue and bring attention to, because I can prove it without doubt. Fago is the name. 30+ years and businesses that bring in more from your death. Motive has such a stench, Fago is guilty as sin along with his daughter, Tammy Johnson. I'm still waiting to be sued, in the mean time, I hope the Fed's and IRS get wind of this. IRS is loosing tons in unpaid taxes, and families are losing loved ones motivated by a facade management company. Cherry Mobile Park, look it up on Google maps, my review isn't as damning as the replies they posted regarding the bugs, cause my name isn't Carrie. Criminal and civil charges are what these murderers are facing.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/tppwcg/property_owners_under_guise_of_being_their_own/",5

"I Have a Job Interview in Riverside In the Summer. What Is It Like? Is It Right For Me?",11,"Riverside","I'll try to keep this brief. I'm from New Jersey originally and currently live in Florida. I'm not happy with Florida. I've been interviewing with a few companies in the Northeast to try and move back there. Recently, a company from Riverside reached out and wanted to set up an interview. California hasn't been my top destination but not my most hated either. I've grown up skateboarding, surfing and recently went snowboarding for the first time. I'm a huge NHRA fan and I love the Dodgers and Vin Scully was my hero (late grandfather was a Brooklyn Dodgers fan).

Even though I love winter, I know Riverside isn't too far from the mountains and snowboarding. I also much prefer a dry heat to Florida humidity. 

What's Riverside itself like. Doing a search, I saw a few posts from I'm assuming NYC transplants that said that a few of Riversides neighborhoods kind of remind them of the Five Boroughs but like a California version. They said that UCR, Arlington, Casa Blanca, Victoria, Woodcrest, La Sierra, Hawarden and Downtown all have a very different feel to them. Can someone elaborate on that? Even if it's brief, I'm really curious. 

Also how popular are action sports in Riverside? I love skateboarding, Surfing and Snowboarding. I know the mountains are a short drive. Do many snowboarders live in the area? Also what about surfing? I know Riverside is inland but are there people who drive to Santa Monica, Carlsbad, San Clemente, etc. On weekends?

Also what about Motocross/Off-roading? I know in California people build ""prerunner"" trucks like they take their old beater F-150s and Silverados and modify them to drive in the desert. Is that popular in the area?

I'm assuming most of the town is kind of quiet? Despite being into action sports, I'm not a part guy at all. I'm really introverted and prefer quiet time at night.

That being said, I do love rock music. All forms, metal, classic and punk. Is there a scene for any of those in Tampa? 

Does the town lean Dodgers or Angels?

Are the LA Kings (or Ducks) and Hockey popular? (I know there is an Ice Rink in town and several in Socal. More than Florida).

What are the rural areas just outside of town like? Are they safe? Is rural property cheap?","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/th56gu/i_have_a_job_interview_in_riverside_in_the_summer/",51

"Local family history of riverside",10,"Riverside","Hello everyone!

I’m a genealogist & I am trained in discovering local California family lineages and stories through historical records.

LINK TO INTEREST FORM:
[Family History Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkGXVpCaZgbVVZi0Goa1NOX2wpK6ui-yTNREYSCVoUV-7zrg/viewform)

This is the interest form I put together for anyone interested in learning more about their California family history. I research & create family trees, historical road trip itineraries, ancestral maps, etc! It’s a super cool way to connect with your own history and great knowledge pass down to future generations.

Here are some things you can discover from my research:

* Newspaper articles about your ancestors (Crime? Scandal? Who knows!)
* Your great-great-great grandparents’ names
* Physical descriptions of your ancestors from census records and war draft cards
* Six full generations back of your family tree
* Photographs of your ancestors you have never seen before (Found in Newspaper archives, I have subscriptions)

If you are interested, please view the interest form at the top with some examples. 🙂Instagram w/ reviews: heritage.hunters

If you have any questions, please feel free to send me a message! For those of you with ancestry outside of California, please send me a message. I’d be happy to help you or direct you to a better suited genealogist. Thanks!","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/s739g0/local_family_history_of_riverside/",2

"La Sierra Hills New Year’s Eve off-roading accident",31,"Riverside","Resident of La Sierra Hills here.

With that said those hills have been blocked off for a reason, this is the second fatal accident in those hills this year  https://www.pe.com/2021/08/07/1-dead-2-critically-injured-in-off-road-crash-near-riversides-la-sierra-hills-neighborhood/amp/ and there have been more in the past. Those hills are quite steep and after all the rain we’ve had very muddy. Having hiked up them many times I can tell you they are extremely difficult to climb on foot, and the rain carves deep grooves into the trail. The fact is they are dangerous to traverse from the La Sierra side even with an off roading vehicle. Please avoid the risk and find other places to ride your vehicles. IMO that field should be made inaccessible for any and all vehicles (except emergency vehicles). Some of the residents (myself included) will call the police if they see people riding up there, since there’s not only the risk of losing lives, but also the risk of starting fires when it’s dry out there.

I have a flight I need to board tomorrow at 4:40pm. I just got a Curative PCR test for it. I need to be negative to check in and board. What are people's experiences with the timeline and turnaround for Riverside/IE Curative PCR tests?

I've gotten three and its been 24 hours or even less once. However, I was wondering if it's any slower or worse currently due to the holidays?","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/rbh5ki/curative_pcr_test_turnaroundtimeline/",4

"Moved to Corona Recently. Need barber shop recommendation.",4,"Riverside","Recently moved to southern Corona. My hair has gotten really long but I dont feel like driving 45 minutes to my old barber place. Are there any good, reliable, affordable barbers out here? I've called a few places and they're charging 30 dollars. I'm not about that life, my old shop was a place with a bunch of very consistent vietnamese barbers, and it was only 15 dollars. I'm not looking to do anything crazy with my hair, just a regular mens cut, maybe a taper cut. Any recommendations? I'm looking to become a regular.","https://www.reddit.com/r/Riverside/comments/rajjb7/moved_to_corona_recently_need_barber_shop/",7
